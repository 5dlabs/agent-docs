# SSE Keep-Alive Implementation Task

You are tasked with implementing a Server-Sent Events (SSE) heartbeat mechanism for the MCP documentation server to maintain stable connections with Toolman clients and prevent connection timeouts. This is a critical infrastructure enhancement for production reliability.

## Objective
Implement a robust SSE keep-alive system that provides stable, long-term connections between the documentation server and Toolman clients, with automatic reconnection and message buffering capabilities.

## Current Problem
The existing MCP server uses basic HTTP/SSE transport without keep-alive mechanisms, causing:
- Frequent connection timeouts with Toolman clients
- Disrupted AI agent workflows requiring manual reconnection
- Unreliable service availability for production use
- No recovery mechanism for network interruptions

## Target Solution
A comprehensive SSE keep-alive system providing:
- Heartbeat messages every 30 seconds to maintain connections
- Connection timeout detection at 90 seconds
- Automatic client-side reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message buffering during disconnection periods
- Connection lifecycle monitoring and metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Server-Side Implementation
1. **SSE Endpoint** (`/sse`)
   ```rust
   // Required HTTP headers
   Content-Type: text/event-stream
   Cache-Control: no-cache
   Connection: keep-alive
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   ```

2. **Heartbeat System**
   - Send keep-alive message every 30 seconds
   - Include timestamp for client verification
   - Use structured event format for different message types

3. **Connection Management**
   - Track active connections in memory or Redis
   - Implement connection cleanup on client disconnect
   - Monitor connection metrics and health

### Client-Side Implementation
1. **Automatic Reconnection**
   ```javascript
   // Exponential backoff parameters
   Initial retry: 1 second
   Maximum retry: 60 seconds
   Jitter: 0-500ms random delay
   ```

2. **Connection State Management**
   - Track connection status (connected, reconnecting, failed)
   - Handle connection lifecycle events
   - Provide status indicators for debugging

### Message Buffering System
1. **Buffer Configuration**
   - Buffer size: 1000 messages per connection
   - Retention time: 5 minutes
   - Optional Redis persistence for scalability

2. **Message Delivery**
   - Queue messages during disconnection
   - Replay buffered messages on reconnection
   - Handle message deduplication and ordering

## Environment Setup

### Database Connection (For Reference)
Export the database URL for any potential database operations:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://rustdocs:rustdocs123@rustdocs-mcp-postgresql.mcp.svc.cluster.local:5432/docs"
```
This environment variable is available for use throughout the implementation if needed for persistence or tracking.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic SSE Infrastructure
1. **Create SSE endpoint** with proper headers and CORS configuration
2. **Implement heartbeat mechanism** with 30-second intervals
3. **Add connection tracking** for active SSE connections
4. **Test basic connectivity** with simple client

### Phase 2: Reconnection Logic
1. **Implement client-side EventSource wrapper** with reconnection
2. **Add exponential backoff** with jitter for retry timing
3. **Create connection state management** and event handling
4. **Test reconnection** under various failure scenarios

### Phase 3: Message Buffering
1. **Design message buffer architecture** (in-memory + optional Redis)
2. **Implement message queuing** during disconnections
3. **Add message replay logic** on reconnection
4. **Handle buffer overflow** and message expiration

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. **Integrate with existing MCP server** endpoints
2. **Add comprehensive logging** and monitoring
3. **Perform load testing** with multiple concurrent connections
4. **Validate Toolman integration** and stability

## Configuration Structure
```rust
pub struct SSEConfig {
    pub heartbeat_interval: Duration,      // 30 seconds
    pub connection_timeout: Duration,      // 90 seconds
    pub initial_retry_delay: Duration,     // 1 second
    pub max_retry_delay: Duration,         // 60 seconds
    pub retry_jitter_max: Duration,        // 500ms
    pub message_buffer_size: usize,        // 1000 messages
    pub buffer_retention: Duration,        // 5 minutes
