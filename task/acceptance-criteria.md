**When**: Connection test is executed
**Then**: 
- Connection establishes within 5 seconds
- Version query returns PostgreSQL version
- pgvector extension is confirmed available

### Test Case 2: Vector Operations
**Given**: pgvector extension installed
**When**: Vector similarity query executed
**Then**:
- 3072-dimension vectors are supported
- Distance calculations return valid results
- No errors for vector operations

### Test Case 3: MCP Server Health
**Given**: MCP server is running
**When**: Health endpoint is queried
**Then**:
- HTTP 200 response received
- Response time < 100ms
- JSON response contains status field

### Test Case 4: Transport Compatibility
**Given**: Current HTTP+SSE implementation
**When**: Compared against MCP 2025-06-18 spec
**Then**:
- All incompatibilities documented
- Required changes listed with effort estimates
- Backward compatibility approach defined

### Test Case 5: Rust Query Tool
**Given**: rust_query tool registered
**When**: Tool is invoked with test query
**Then**:
- Tool responds within 2 seconds

## Validation Criteria

### Automated Validation
```bash
# All these commands should complete successfully
cargo test --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
```

### Manual Validation
1. **Stakeholder Review**: Technical lead approves assessment findings
2. **Migration Feasibility**: Plan is executable with available resources
3. **Risk Acceptance**: Identified risks have mitigation strategies
4. **Timeline Validation**: Estimates align with project constraints
5. **Completeness Check**: No critical areas left unassessed

## Definition of Done

Task 1 is complete when:

1. **All assessments completed**: Every component analyzed and documented
2. **Tests executed**: Full test suite run with results recorded
3. **Gaps identified**: Clear list of improvements needed
4. **Migration path defined**: Step-by-step plan to Streamable HTTP
5. **Stakeholder alignment**: Findings reviewed and accepted
6. **Documentation delivered**: All required documents in `.taskmaster/docs/task-1/`
7. **Next steps clear**: Tasks 2-20 can proceed based on findings

## Success Metrics
