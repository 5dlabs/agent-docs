# Task ID: 18
# Title: Data Migration and Validation Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Populate the freshly provisioned database (184 MB of documentation data) immediately after system assessment (Task 1) and database connection setup (Task 6). Implement an automated data-migration pipeline with full validation and rollback so that all subsequent query-tool tasks (Tasks 7-11) have reliable data to operate on.
# Details:
• Create migration scripts for each documentation type using the doc-loader crate.
• Support a blank-database bootstrap scenario: initial full load followed by optional incremental migrations with checkpointing.
• Add data-validation steps (checksums, record counts, schema conformance) and duplicate detection/merging.
• Provide rollback procedures for any failed migration batch.
• Run migrations in parallel where safe to achieve ≥ 1000 docs/minute on the 184 MB dataset.
• Emit progress events with percentage complete and ETA; persist migration history in the database.
• Expose a CLI command and Kubernetes Job template so the pipeline can be triggered right after Tasks 1 & 6 complete.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute full migration against an empty test database; verify all 184 MB load successfully with matching checksums and document counts.
2. Simulate failures mid-migration and ensure rollback leaves database in a consistent pre-migration state.
3. Re-run pipeline to confirm idempotency (no duplicates, no data loss).
4. Benchmark performance, targeting ≥ 1000 docs/minute throughput on the reference cluster.
5. Validate progress/ETA reporting and confirm migration history entries are recorded.
