# Toolman Guide: OpenAI Embedding Client with Batch Processing

## Tool Selection Rationale
Filesystem tools for creating embedding client modules, implementing batch processing, and establishing cost tracking systems.

## Implementation Approach
1. **read_file**: Examine existing embedding client code
2. **write_file**: Create batch API client and processing modules
3. **edit_file**: Update embedding integration points
4. **search_files**: Find all embedding usage locations

## Key Focus Areas
- **Batch Optimization**: Maximize cost savings through efficient batching
- **Rate Limiting**: Comply with OpenAI API limits
- **Error Resilience**: Handle API failures gracefully
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track and validate savings accurately
