# Task ID: 6
# Title: OpenAI Batch Processing Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement batched processing for OpenAI API calls to reduce costs and improve efficiency for embedding generation.
# Details:
1. Create a batching service for OpenAI API calls
2. Implement queue for collecting embedding requests
3. Process in batches of 100 items per request (OpenAI's optimal batch size)
4. Add timeout mechanism to process partial batches
5. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. Add monitoring for cost tracking

Technologies:
- OpenAI API with text-embedding-ada-002 model
- Use async/await for non-blocking batch processing
- Implement Redis or similar for distributed queue
- Use backoff library for retry logic
- Consider implementing token counting to optimize batch sizes
- Use tiktoken library for accurate token counting

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify cost reduction meets 70% target
2. Test with various batch sizes to confirm optimal performance
3. Validate retry logic under API failure conditions
4. Test timeout mechanism for partial batches
5. Verify embedding quality is maintained
6. Benchmark processing throughput under load
