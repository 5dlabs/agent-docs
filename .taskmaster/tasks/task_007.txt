# Task ID: 7
# Title: Jupyter Query Tool Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'jupyter_query' tool for searching and retrieving information from Jupyter notebook documentation.
# Details:
1. Create 'jupyter_query' MCP tool implementation
2. Develop Jupyter notebook parser to extract content and metadata
3. Process code cells, markdown cells, and outputs separately
4. Generate embeddings for notebook content
5. Implement semantic search functionality
6. Add result formatting specific to notebook structure

Technologies:
- nbformat 5.7+ for parsing Jupyter notebooks
- Consider jupytext for additional format support
- Store cell types and metadata in JSONB for flexible querying
- Use OpenAI embeddings with appropriate chunking strategy
- Implement syntax highlighting for code cells in results
- Consider markdown rendering for presentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with various notebook formats and versions
2. Verify parsing accuracy for complex notebooks
3. Test search relevance with different query types
4. Validate handling of code vs. markdown content
5. Test with notebooks containing various programming languages
6. Verify result formatting maintains notebook structure
