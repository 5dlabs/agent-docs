# Task ID: 12
# Title: Rate Limiting and API Protection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rate limiting and API protection mechanisms to ensure system stability and prevent abuse.
# Details:
1. Implement rate limiting at 3000 RPM / 1M TPM as specified
2. Add per-client rate limiting based on API keys
3. Implement graduated response to rate limit violations
4. Add request validation and sanitization
5. Implement API key management
6. Add monitoring and alerting for abuse patterns

Technologies:
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Implement token bucket algorithm for rate control
- Consider using rate-limiter-flexible library
- Implement proper HTTP status codes (429 Too Many Requests)
- Add Retry-After headers for client guidance
- Use API gateway pattern for centralized protection
- Consider implementing JWT for authentication

# Test Strategy:
1. Test rate limiting under various load patterns
2. Verify correct handling of rate limit violations
3. Test with simulated abuse patterns
4. Validate API key management functionality
5. Test distributed rate limiting across multiple instances
6. Verify monitoring correctly identifies abuse patterns
