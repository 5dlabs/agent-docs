# Task ID: 21
# Title: Documentation Consolidation and Cleanup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Consolidate all project documentation into two essential files (architecture.md and prd.md) while removing duplicate and outdated documentation to provide a clean handoff for the new implementation agent.
# Details:
1. Architecture Documentation Consolidation:
   - Extract and merge architectural decisions from existing documentation
   - Document current system components and their interactions
   - Include database schema and data model details
   - Document service dependencies and integration points
   - Add deployment architecture and configuration details
   - Include performance considerations and scaling decisions

2. PRD Documentation Consolidation:
   - Consolidate current state of the system
   - Document all implemented features and their status
   - List pending features and future requirements
   - Include API specifications and endpoints
   - Document known limitations and technical debt
   - Add roadmap and priority considerations

3. Documentation Cleanup Process:
   - Audit existing documentation in .taskmaster/docs/
   - Create inventory of all documentation files
   - Identify duplicate content across files
   - Mark outdated information for removal
   - Archive historical documentation for reference
   - Remove redundant and obsolete files

4. Quality Assurance:
   - Verify technical accuracy of consolidated documentation
   - Ensure all critical information is preserved
   - Validate links and references
   - Check formatting and structure consistency
   - Review for completeness and clarity

5. Implementation Considerations:
   - Use Markdown for consistent formatting
   - Include table of contents in both files
   - Add version control information
   - Document last review/update dates
   - Include contact information for key stakeholders

# Test Strategy:
1. Documentation Completeness Verification:
   - Compare consolidated files against source documentation
   - Verify all architectural decisions are captured
   - Confirm all current features are documented
   - Validate all requirements are preserved
   - Check for missing technical specifications

2. Technical Accuracy Testing:
   - Review architecture.md against actual system implementation
   - Verify database schema documentation matches production
   - Validate API endpoint documentation
   - Test all documented configuration settings
   - Verify deployment instructions

3. Documentation Cleanup Validation:
   - Confirm removal of duplicate files
   - Verify no critical information was lost
   - Check for broken documentation links
   - Validate cross-references between files
   - Ensure no orphaned documentation remains

4. Usability Testing:
   - Have team members review documentation clarity
   - Verify documentation searchability
   - Test navigation and structure
   - Validate markdown rendering
   - Check mobile/desktop readability
