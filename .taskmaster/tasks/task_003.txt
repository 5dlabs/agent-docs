# Task ID: 3
# Title: Health Monitoring and Diagnostics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance health monitoring endpoints to provide detailed system status and diagnostics for the documentation server.
# Details:
1. Implement comprehensive health check endpoint (/health)
2. Add detailed status endpoint with component-level health (/status)
3. Implement metrics collection for:
   - Query response times
   - Connection counts
   - Database performance
   - OpenAI API usage
4. Add logging for critical operations with appropriate log levels
5. Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
6. Create dashboard for monitoring system health

Technologies:
- Prometheus 2.40+ for metrics collection
- Grafana 9.3+ for visualization
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Implement health checks using standard HTTP status codes
- Use Hystrix or similar for circuit breaking
- Consider OpenTelemetry 1.0+ for distributed tracing

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify health endpoints return correct status under various conditions
2. Test circuit breakers by simulating dependency failures
3. Validate metrics collection accuracy
4. Verify logs contain appropriate information for troubleshooting
5. Test dashboard functionality with simulated load
6. Verify alerts trigger appropriately on failure conditions
