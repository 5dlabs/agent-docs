# Task ID: 14
# Title: Performance Optimization and Scaling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize system performance and implement scaling capabilities to handle increased load and data volume.
# Details:
1. Implement database query optimization
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Optimize vector search parameters
   - Implement query caching
2. Add connection pooling and load balancing
3. Implement horizontal scaling capability
4. Add performance monitoring and alerting
5. Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
6. Implement data partitioning strategy for large collections

Technologies:
- Use pgvector's HNSW indexing for faster vector search
- Implement Redis for query caching
- Consider PgBouncer for connection pooling
- Use load balancing with consistent hashing
- Implement database read replicas where appropriate
- Consider implementing database sharding for horizontal scaling
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark query performance under various loads
2. Test scaling with simulated traffic increases
3. Verify cache hit rates and effectiveness
4. Test failover and recovery scenarios
5. Validate performance with large document collections
6. Verify system handles 100+ concurrent connections
