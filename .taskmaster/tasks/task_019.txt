# Task ID: 19
# Title: Docker Development Environment Setup
# Status: review
# Dependencies: 1, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive Docker Compose development environment with PostgreSQL (pgvector), development scripts, and production-ready configurations for the MCP server, including proper database initialization and environment management.
# Details:
1. Docker Compose Configuration:
   - Create docker-compose.yml using v2 syntax
   - Configure PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension
   - Set custom port 5433 to avoid conflicts
   - Configure volume mounts for data persistence
   - Set up proper networking between services

2. Database Initialization:
   - Create init.sql script for database setup
   - Configure user creation with proper permissions
   - Initialize required extensions (pgvector)
   - Set up initial schema based on Task 16's harmonized structure
   - Implement health checks

3. Development Scripts:
   - Create dev.sh script with functions:
     * Environment validation
     * Docker health checks
     * Database migration handling
     * Service startup orchestration
   - Create stop.sh for graceful shutdown
   - Add logs.sh for consolidated logging

4. Production Dockerfile:
   - Multi-stage build for MCP server
   - Optimize layer caching
   - Implement security best practices
   - Configure proper user permissions
   - Set up health checks
   - Optimize image size

5. Environment Management:
   - Create .env.example template
   - Document all required variables
   - Implement validation for required values
   - Set up separate production/development configs
   - Add secure secret management

6. Documentation:
   - Write clear setup instructions
   - Document all environment variables
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Include production deployment notes
   - Document backup/restore procedures

7. Implementation Status and Validation Requirements:
   - Infrastructure components created and configured:
     * Docker Compose configurations (docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.dev.yml)
     * Production Dockerfile with multi-stage build
     * Development scripts (dev.sh, stop.sh)
     * Database initialization scripts
     * 67MB database dump for restoration
     * DEV_SETUP.md documentation

   - Known Issues:
     * Port conflicts with local PostgreSQL instances
     * Environment variable conflicts between shell and .env
     * Database connection stability issues
     * Incomplete end-to-end workflow validation

   - Required Validation Steps:
     * Complete ./scripts/dev.sh --with-data workflow from clean state
     * Database dump restoration process
     * MCP server startup with populated database
     * Docker environment and MCP server integration
     * Port configuration and connection stability testing

   - Final Acceptance Criteria:
     * Successful clean environment setup on new system
     * Working ./scripts/dev.sh --with-data end-to-end flow
     * Verified database dump restoration
     * Functional MCP server with restored data
     * Stable port configurations and connections

# Test Strategy:
1. Development Environment Testing:
   - Verify clean installation on fresh system
   - Test database initialization and schema creation
   - Validate pgvector extension functionality
   - Confirm port configuration and accessibility
   - Test volume persistence across restarts

2. Script Validation:
   - Test dev.sh script on multiple platforms
   - Verify stop.sh graceful shutdown
   - Validate error handling in scripts
   - Test concurrent service startup
   - Verify logging functionality

3. Database Configuration:
   - Validate user permissions
   - Test database connections
   - Verify schema initialization
   - Confirm backup/restore procedures
   - Test migration scripts

4. Production Setup:
   - Build production Docker image
   - Validate multi-stage build optimization
   - Test security configurations
   - Verify resource constraints
   - Validate environment variable handling

5. Integration Testing:
   - Test compatibility with existing services
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Validate service discovery
   - Test with sample workload
   - Verify monitoring integration
