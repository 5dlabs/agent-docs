# Task ID: 11
# Title: Unified Search Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a unified search capability across all documentation types while maintaining type-specific querying.
# Details:
1. Create a unified search interface that can query across all doc types
2. Implement type filtering and boosting
3. Develop result ranking algorithm that works across doc types
4. Add metadata-based filtering options
5. Implement result deduplication
6. Create consistent result formatting across types

Technologies:
- Use PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities alongside vector search
- Implement hybrid retrieval combining BM25 and vector similarity
- Use query classification to determine intent and doc type relevance
- Consider implementing Cross-Encoder reranking for better relevance
- Use metadata filtering with GIN indexes for performance
- Implement proper result pagination and cursor-based navigation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search across multiple documentation types
2. Verify result relevance across different domains
3. Test with ambiguous queries that could match multiple doc types
4. Validate filtering and sorting functionality
5. Benchmark performance with large result sets
6. Test deduplication with similar content across doc types
