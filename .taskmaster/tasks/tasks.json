        "details": "1. Create a backup of the existing 'rust_docs_vectors' database\n2. Create new 'docs' database with pgvector extension\n3. Implement the harmonized schema with the following tables:\n   - documents (id, doc_type, source_name, doc_path, content, metadata, embedding)\n   - document_sources (id, doc_type, source_name, config, enabled)\n4. Migrate existing Rust documentation data to the new schema\n5. Verify data integrity after migration\n6. Update connection strings in application code\n\nTechnologies:\n- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector 0.5.0+\n- Use pg_dump/pg_restore for safe migration\n- Implement JSONB for metadata to support type-specific information\n- Use vector(3072) for OpenAI embeddings compatibility\n- Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization\n<info added on 2025-08-03T16:43:50.386Z>\n## Updated Implementation Approach\n\nInstead of the original sequential approach, we will implement a parallel development strategy:\n\n1. Create new `docs` database with harmonized schema first (documents + document_sources tables)\n2. Verify schema supports all planned documentation types (Rust, Python, JavaScript, etc.)\n3. Migrate existing 40 Rust crates from `rust_docs_vectors` to new schema\n4. Validate data integrity and search functionality with migrated data\n5. Update application to use new database\n\nThis approach provides immediate access to working data while building new features, allowing for faster development and testing cycles. The harmonized schema will be implemented from the start, with existing Rust documentation serving as the initial data set to validate functionality.\n</info added on 2025-08-03T16:43:50.386Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-03T16:47:30.977Z>\n## Migration Completion Report\n\n### Successfully Completed Database Creation and Migration\n\n**New harmonized database created:**\n- `docs` database with pgvector extension enabled\n- Documents table supporting all 10 planned doc_types (rust, jupyter, birdeye, cilium, talos, meteora, raydium, solana, ebpf, rust_best_practices)\n- Document_sources table for source configuration\n- Proper JSONB metadata support for type-specific data\n\n**Migration completed:**\n- 40 Rust crates migrated from `rust_docs_vectors` to new schema\n- 4,133 documents with embeddings successfully transferred\n- All documents have 3072-dimensional OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)\n- Vector similarity search verified working (no index due to pgvector 2000-dim limit, following reference WIP implementation)\n\n**Database ready for:**\n- New MCP tools implementation \n- Additional documentation type ingestion\n- Full application integration\n\nNext steps: Implement actual MCP server functionality and query tools.\n</info added on 2025-08-03T16:47:30.977Z>",

Add initial dependencies to each crate as appropriate (tokio for async runtime, sqlx for database, serde for serialization, dotenvy for env management, tracing for logging, etc.). Use the latest stable versions and specify common dev-dependencies in the workspace-level Cargo.toml where possible.\n3. Establish a basic module structure in each crate (e.g., lib.rs with submodules for core functionality). Stub out main.rs for binaries if needed.\n4. Configure development tooling: add rustfmt.toml and clippy.toml at the root with recommended settings (e.g., enforce formatting, deny warnings). Optionally, set up pre-commit hooks for formatting/linting.\n5. Create a Dockerfile for the main binary crate, using the official Rust image, multi-stage build for smaller images, and install system dependencies for sqlx/postgres. Add a docker-compose.yml for local development, including a PostgreSQL service with pgvector extension enabled.\n6. Add a .env.example file at the root with all required environment variables (database URL, API keys, etc.).\n7. Write a README.md with project overview, workspace structure, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. Create a 'docs/' directory for future documentation expansion.\n8.

Use robust HTML parsing (e.g., BeautifulSoup, lxml) to locate and extract JSON data from data-initial-props attributes, handling dynamic content and edge cases. 3. Parse and normalize the extracted JSON to isolate API endpoint details, parameters, descriptions, and usage examples. 4. Clean and transform the data to fit the harmonized database schema, ensuring doc_type='birdeye' and consistent field mapping. 5. Integrate with the existing embedding generation pipeline (leveraging OpenAI or similar models) to create vector representations for each documentation chunk. 6. Store the processed documentation and embeddings in the database, ensuring idempotency and traceability. 7.
