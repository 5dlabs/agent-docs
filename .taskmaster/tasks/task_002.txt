# Task ID: 2
# Title: SSE Keep-Alive Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) heartbeat mechanism to maintain stable connections with Toolman and prevent timeouts.
# Details:
1. Implement SSE endpoint with heartbeat functionality
2. Configure heartbeat interval to 30 seconds
3. Add connection timeout detection at 90 seconds
4. Implement client-side reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Initial retry: 1 second
   - Max retry: 60 seconds
   - Jitter: 0-500ms
5. Add message buffering during disconnection periods
6. Implement connection status tracking

Technologies:
- Use EventSource API for client-side SSE handling
- Implement with appropriate HTTP headers:
  - 'Content-Type: text/event-stream'
  - 'Cache-Control: no-cache'
  - 'Connection: keep-alive'
- Use Redis 7.0+ for message buffering (optional)
- Implement using async/await patterns for efficient connection handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Simulate network interruptions to verify reconnection
2. Test with artificial delays to ensure heartbeat functionality
3. Verify message delivery during reconnection periods
4. Load test with 100+ concurrent connections
5. Monitor connection stability over extended periods
6. Verify timeout detection works correctly
