# Task ID: 1
# Title: Database Migration and Schema Harmonization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate the existing PostgreSQL database from 'rust_docs_vectors' to 'docs' with a harmonized schema supporting multiple documentation types.
# Details:
1. Create a backup of the existing 'rust_docs_vectors' database
2. Create new 'docs' database with pgvector extension
3. Implement the harmonized schema with the following tables:
   - documents (id, doc_type, source_name, doc_path, content, metadata, embedding)
   - document_sources (id, doc_type, source_name, config, enabled)
4. Migrate existing Rust documentation data to the new schema
5. Verify data integrity after migration
6. Update connection strings in application code

Technologies:
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector 0.5.0+
- Use pg_dump/pg_restore for safe migration
- Implement JSONB for metadata to support type-specific information
- Use vector(3072) for OpenAI embeddings compatibility
- Add appropriate indexes for performance optimization

## Updated Implementation Approach

Instead of the original sequential approach, we will implement a parallel development strategy:

1. Create new `docs` database with harmonized schema first (documents + document_sources tables)
2. Verify schema supports all planned documentation types (Rust, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
3. Migrate existing 40 Rust crates from `rust_docs_vectors` to new schema
4. Validate data integrity and search functionality with migrated data
5. Update application to use new database

This approach provides immediate access to working data while building new features, allowing for faster development and testing cycles. The harmonized schema will be implemented from the start, with existing Rust documentation serving as the initial data set to validate functionality.

## Migration Completion Report

### Successfully Completed Database Creation and Migration

**New harmonized database created:**
- `docs` database with pgvector extension enabled
- Documents table supporting all 10 planned doc_types (rust, jupyter, birdeye, cilium, talos, meteora, raydium, solana, ebpf, rust_best_practices)
- Document_sources table for source configuration
- Proper JSONB metadata support for type-specific data

**Migration completed:**
- 40 Rust crates migrated from `rust_docs_vectors` to new schema
- 4,133 documents with embeddings successfully transferred
- All documents have 3072-dimensional OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
- Vector similarity search verified working (no index due to pgvector 2000-dim limit, following reference WIP implementation)

**Database ready for:**
- New MCP tools implementation 
- Additional documentation type ingestion
- Full application integration

Next steps: Implement actual MCP server functionality and query tools.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify row count matches between old and new databases
2. Run sample queries against both databases and compare results
3. Validate schema integrity with SQL validation scripts
4. Test vector search functionality on migrated data
5. Benchmark query performance to ensure â‰¤10% degradation
6. Verify all 40 existing Rust crates remain searchable
