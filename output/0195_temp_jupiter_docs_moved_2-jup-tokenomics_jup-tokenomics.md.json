It represents the interests of the Jupiter DAO. LFG and Governance Votes both utilize the $JUP Token in the ASR voting process. \n 1 $JUP = 1 vote \n \n Total Supply:  10 Billion \n \n $Jupuary Airdrops:  40% - 4 Billion \n Jupiter Team:  20% - 2 Billion \n Strategic Reserve:  20% - 2 Billion \n Contributors and Grants:  10% - 1 Billion \n Liquidity Provision:  10% - 1 Billion \n \n \n Token Circulation \n \n Team-Managed Allocation (50% of Total Supply) \n Current Team Members (20%) \n \n Vesting: One year cliff, two years vesting. \n \n Strategic Reserve (20%) \n \n Purpose: strategic reserve, used for future team members, future strategic investors, and for past Mercurial stakeholders (now Meteora). \n Conditions for usage. \n \n Liquidity Provision (10%) \n \n Explanation of liquidity provision strategy. \n Details of implementation. \n Used in the first year. \n \n Community Distribution (50% of Total Supply) \n Airdrops (40%) \n \n 4 Rounds of Airdrops. First dropped 1 billion tokens on January 31st of 2024, due for 3 more each January until 2027 (if my math is right lol). \n Criteria for eligibility and distribution process - always uncertain to prevent farming but using the Jupiter swap in an organic manner is a very good bet. \n \n Contributors and Grants (10%) \n \n Purpose: supporting community members contributing to Jupiterâ€™s ecosystem. \n Administration via JUP DAO. \n \n \n Governance and Community Engagement \n \n Governance in regards to DAO actions takes place utilizing the $JUP token as the vote count mechanism. 1 $JUP = 1 Vote \n The LFG Launchpads' voting process also hinges on $JUP holder votes to select projects to launch. 75% of the fees generated from the launchpad are returned to the users who vote, in the form of ASR or Active Staking Rewards. 100mm $JUP has been injected into the ASR pool as an additional reward for Voters in the first two quarters of voting. \n ASR, or Active Staking Rewards takes into account the activity of $JUP holders as they participate in the governance and launchpad processes to allocate rewards to active community members that have staked and vote on DAO actions.",
