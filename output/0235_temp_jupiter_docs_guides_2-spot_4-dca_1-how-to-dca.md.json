Check out this  Explainer Page  to learn more about DCA other use cases. \n Basic DCA User Flow \n \n First, navigate to the  Jupiter Website  and then click on the  DCA  icon below the top navigation bar.  Double check  that the URL in your search bar is correct: https://jup.ag/dca/ \n Next, connect your wallet by clicking the  Connect Wallet  button in the upper right corner of the site. \n Select the token you are allocating and the token you are going to be buying on the DCA terminal. \n Enter the amount of the token you want to allocate to the DCA orders in the amount field. \n Set the Frequency(Every) and the Duration(Over) for the DCA orders. \n Double check the Order Summary details and if things look good, click the  Start DCA  button. \n Confirm the wallet notification and the DCA Order will be submitted to the system. \n A notification toast will appear in the lower left corner that will notify the user once the transaction has been sent and has completed. \n Your new DCA will populate the Active DCAs section below the Terminal once it is confirmed and the UI updates. \n You can expand the Active DCAs and inspect the progress of the DCA in the Overview tab, or inspect the individual orders on the Order tab. \n \n Let's go through the DCA Settings in more detail below. \n \n Jupiter DCA Settings \n \n \n DCA:  Select the DCA tab in the product navigation menu to arrive at the DCA terminal. \n Input Token Selector:  Select the token you want to spend/ allocate with your DCA orders. \n Input Field:  Enter the amount of the input tokens that you are looking to spend/ allocate with your DCA orders. \n Output Token Selector:  Select the token that you are looking to DCA into or Buy. \n Frequency:  Specify the time frequency for the DCA orders with a numerical input and the dropdown selector. \n Duration:  The number of orders you want the DCA to be spread out over. \n Order Summary:  Specify the details for the current DCA order that you are creating.\nIn this example:\n \n Sell Total - 50 USDC (You are selling USDC) \n Sell Per Order - The Sell Total divided by the numerical duration entry.
