I tried opening a position/adding collateral and it’s not successful. Where is my fund? \n Fund will be returned to your wallet address in about 1-2 mins. There might be a delay for the fund to be returned when the network is congested. In that case, you can always close your expired request under the  Expired Orders  tab. \n Check out this  link  on how to look up for your returned fund. \n :::info\nWallet service providers might not be fully parsing the transactions, so, it is always a better idea to check on-chain. If you still couldn’t locate your fund although it was shown that it’s returned on the explorers, please contact your wallet service provider accordingly.\n::: \n 2. I closed my position with profit and I have not received my fund. \n You will receive the underlying asset for LONG-position, i.e. SOL for SOL-Long, ETH for ETH-Long, wBTC for wBTC-Long. \n You will receive either USDC or USDT for all SHORT-positions. \n Check out this  link  on how to check for fund from closed positions. \n 3. The price has reached my TP/SL price on the chart. Why is my TP/SL not triggered? \n \n \n Missing Associated Token Accounts \n We won't be able to trigger a TP/SL if there is no active token account for the user. These are the associated token accounts (ATAs) needed for each position. \n \n ETH Token Account for ETH-Long; \n wBTC Token Account for wBTC-Long; \n USDC and USDT Token Account for ALL Short positions. \n \n \n \n Oracle Price Not Reached \n There are two oracles that we are using for TP/SL, the Pyth Mainnet Oracles and the Pyth Pythnet oracles. For full detail, please refer  here . \n Our chart data is using the  Pythnet oracles  and the positions uses the  Mainnet oracles . \n \n \n If you are sure that you have an active ATA for the position and check the Mainnet oracle price and confirm that TP/SL is not triggered at the price it is supposed to, please open a  Perp-ticket . \n 4. Why is my liquidation price changing? \n There is an hourly borrow fee on every position, the hourly borrow fee will change the liquidation price over time. \n If you want to understand how the hourly borrow rate works, you can check it out  here . \n 5. I deposited 1 SOL (where 1 SOL = $100) for a 5x leveraged SOL-Long position, profited $50 (where 1 SOL = $110). Why did I get less amount? Why didn’t I get back 1.5 SOL? \n Assuming zero fees, with $50 profit, you will be getting SOL in return with value of $150.\nAt the time of closing the position, 1 SOL = $110, \n $150 / $110 = 1.3636\n \n You will be getting 1.3636 SOL where the value is equivalent to $150. \n \n Here is another example, this is a SOL-Long position, the total amount the user should be getting is $3086.28 in SOL. \n The value of SOL at the time is $189.28, hence  $3086.28 / $189.28 = 16.30 . The user will be receiving 16.30 SOL in return. \n :::info\nThe  PNL  shown is the amount before fees. The exact amount is shown under  Deposit/Withdraw  tab.\n::: \n 6. I have an existing SOL-Long position. I deposited 1 SOL to open a new SOL-Long position but I don’t see my new position. \n Both positions will be combined into one position, where \n \n Leverage of the combined position = Average of the leverage level of each position.\ne.g. (1.2x + 1.4x) / 2 = 1.3x \n Size = initial collateral * leverage level. \n \n The TP/SL you have set earlier will remain the same after the positions are combined.",
