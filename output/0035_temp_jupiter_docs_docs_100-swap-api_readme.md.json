If you are first starting out on your Solana development journey, using Ultra API is highly recommended over Swap API. \n However, unlike Ultra API, Swap API allows developers to: \n \n Add custom instructions. \n Add Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls. \n Choose the broadcasting strategy for the signed transaction (ie. via priority fee, Jito, etc.). \n Choose which DEXes or AMMs to route through. \n Modify the number of accounts to use in a transaction. \n \n If you have a highly custom need like what is described above, then Swap API may be for you. However, with Swap API, there are many more things you need to worry about that Ultra API automatically handles for: \n \n Upkeep of RPCs : To retrieve wallet balances, broadcast and retrieve transactions, etc. \n Deciding transaction fee : Including, but not limited to, priority fee, Jito fee, etc. \n Deciding slippage : The optimal slippage to use to balance between trade success and price protection, do note that  RTSE is only available via Ultra API . \n Broadcasting the transaction : Ultra uses a proprietary transaction sending engine which dramatically improves landing rate and speed. \n Parsing the swap results : Polling and parsing the resulting transaction from the RPC, including handling for success and error cases. \n \n If the above sounds like too much work, then Ultra API will be the better choice. \n Getting Started with Swap API \n \n Get Quote : Request for a quote which consists of the route plan, and other params such as integrator fee, slippage, etc. \n Build Swap Transaction : Post the quote to build a swap transaction.\n \n You can utilize other methods to return swap instructions or use CPI rather than the default swap transaction. \n You can utilize other parameters such as priority fee, dynamic slippage, etc to customize the transaction. \n \n \n Send Swap Transaction : Sign and send the swap transaction to the network via your preferred RPC or other methods. \n \n Other Guides \n \n Adding Fees to Swap API : Add custom integrator fees to the swap transaction. \n Using Swap API as a payment method : Use Swap API as a payment method for your users. \n Using Jupiter Plugin : Lite version of Jupiter that provides end-to-end swap with just a few lines of code.",
