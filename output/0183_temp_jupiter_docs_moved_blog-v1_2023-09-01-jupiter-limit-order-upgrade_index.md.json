Unlike before, where it was restricted to specific base tokens like USDT, USDC, and SOL, this update leverages an upgraded Limit Order contract and Jupiter's latest routing algorithm to empower trading of any token pairs. This expansion broadens the scope, providing users with even more trading options and opportunities. \n \n TradingView Chart \n Empowering your Jupiter Limit Order experience further, we've integrated our trading chart with TradingView, utilizing data from BirdEye. This integration offers a comprehensive TradingView chart within our platform, making it much easier to perform technical analysis and place limit orders with a few clicks through the interface. \n \n It's important to note that while this integration offers exceptional functionality, some low liquidity token pairs might face limitations due to insufficient historical data. \n Keeper/Taker guideline \n We are coming up with a comprehensive guidelines for users and developers interested in running their own keepers or takers, complete with example code. This initiative will empower more participants in the system to efficiently run and execute orders, potentially benefiting from order profit execution and positive slippage. \n The taker code facilitates keepers in accessing, filtering, and sorting open orders on-chain based on price. Furthermore, keepers can gather quotes from the Jupiter Swap API to evaluate trade profitability. Notably, this integration also enables the merging of Jupiter Swap Instructions with Limit Order Instructions, streamlining execution. \n This enhancement enables a broader group of keepers to participate in executing Jupiter Limit Orders, thus enhancing order execution and decentralization. \n Check out GH Repo here \n 0% Fees for placing orders \n Considering all these updates, we're making a significant alteration to the fee structure: reducing  Jupiter Limit Order fees to 0% for placing orders .
