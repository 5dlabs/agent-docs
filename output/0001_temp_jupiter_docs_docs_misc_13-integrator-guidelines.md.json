The following section provides the guidelines when integrating with Jupiter. \n Branding and Marketing \n When integrating with Jupiter, you can use the following assets to help you brand and market your product:  Jupiter Brand Assets . \n :::caution Labelling Routing Provider\nDo note that, if you are using our routing engine (such as getting quotes from the Swap API), you are to label the routing provider as  \"Jupiter Metis v1\" , and not \"Jupiter\".\n::: \n Developer Support \n There are currently 2 ways to get technical support: \n \n Public Developer Support Channel in Discord \n Portal Enquiry \n \n :::warning\nPlease use the Discord channel for your technical questions, as it is a public channel, more people can help you and it promotes discovery/discussion. \n If you open a ticket via the link that  does not relate  to Portal Enquiries, we will redirect you to the Discord channel.\n::: \n Customer Support \n The Jupiter UI contains multiple safeguards, warnings and default settings to guide our users to trade safer. However, when you integrate with Jupiter, we cannot control these elements despite sharing best practices, hence, Jupiter is not liable for any losses incurred on your UI/platform. \n The only exception is for Jupiter Ultra API, where you can use our ticketing system to provide support to your users. \n :::warning\nWe are still in the process of finalizing the Ultra API customer support process. \n Reach out to  us  to discuss what is the best way to support your users.\n:::",
