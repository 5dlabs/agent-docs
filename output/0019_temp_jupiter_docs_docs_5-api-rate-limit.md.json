For example, if your tier allows 100 requests per 10 seconds, any more within that window will receive a 429 response, regardless of how few you used in the previous window. \n Tier Est. Requests per Minute Requests Per Period Sliding Window Period \n Lite 60 60 60 seconds \n Pro I ~600 100 10 seconds \n Pro II ~3,000 500 10 seconds \n Pro III ~6,000 1,000 10 seconds \n Pro IV ~30,000 5,000 10 seconds \n \n Requests are distributed to each bucket: \n \n Price API Bucket  – dedicated for  /price/v3/  only - separate from Default Bucket. \n Default Bucket  – used for all APIs except the Price API. \n \n :::note \n \n Each bucket enforces its own sliding window independently. \n For example, Pro II = 500 per 10 seconds to the Default Bucket and 500 per 10 seconds to the Price API Bucket. \n Lite users do not have a separate Price API Bucket — all requests are counted against the Default Bucket.\n::: \n \n Dynamic Rate Limit (BETA) \n The  Ultra API  uses a unique rate limiting mechanism that scales with your  executed swap volume  over time. \n Property Dynamic \n Base URL https://api.jup.ag/ultra/ \n Cost Free to use, but Ultra incurs swap fees \n API Key Required \n Requests Per Minute Base Quota + Added Quota \n \n How Dynamic Rate Limit Works \n Every  10 minutes \n \n The system aggregates your swap volume from  /execute  on Ultra for  the current rolling day  (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present). \n After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota. \n \n Swap Volume Requests Per Period Sliding Window Period \n $0 50 Base + 0 Added = 50 10 seconds \n $10,000 50 Base + 1 Added = 51 10 seconds \n $100,000 50 Base + 11 Added = 61 10 seconds \n $1,000,000 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 10 seconds \n \n :::note\nThe formula is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system. \n If you find that the rate limit is too restrictive, please reach out to us in Discord.\n::: \n Managing Rate Limits \n If you receive a 429 response, you should: \n \n Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic \n Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests \n Upgrade your tier (Pro)  or  scale your Ultra usage  to unlock higher limits. \n \n :::caution\nBursting beyond your allocation may result in  temporary 429s/rate limits , even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.\n:::",
