Below are some resources to help you quickly get started. There are a different ways to setup such as via the Jupiter Referral Dashboard or using the provided scripts. \n \n Jupiter Referral Dashboard : To view and manage your referral accounts used with Jupiter APIs. \n Add Fees to Ultra API : To add fees to your Ultra API integration. \n Add Fees to Swap and Trigger API : To add fees to your Swap and Trigger API integration. \n Add Fees to Jupiter Plugin : To add fees to your Plugin integration. \n \n Other Program Integrators \n Project Usage \n If you have a project/product that runs a program on the Solana blockchain, you can integrate the Referral Program to allow/share revenue with the integrators of your program. \n Similar to how Jupiter Programs uses the Referral Program to help developers earn fees and/or share the revenue with Jupiter. For example, Jupiter Ultra uses the Jupiter Swap program which relies on the Referral Program. \n \n Create a  Project  by calling  initialize_project  with your chosen  base  key and a project  name  ( base  key refers to a key identifier of your project). \n Set a  default_share_bps  to share the fees with your referrers (or integrators). \n An example of a  Project  account:  Jupiter Ultra Project \n \n Referrer Usage \n If you are a referrer such as a developer or integrator of a project that runs a program on the Solana blockchain, you can create the necessary accounts via the Referral Program to earn fees. \n \n The program must be integrated with the Referral Program. \n Create a  Referral  account by calling  initialize_referral_account  with the correct  Project  account, the  Referral  account, and your own  Partner  account ( Partner  account is the admin of this referral account). \n Create the necessary  Referral  token accounts for the  Referral  account to receive fees in.",
