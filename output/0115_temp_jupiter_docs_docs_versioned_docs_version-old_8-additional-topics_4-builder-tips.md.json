Managing secrets can feel like extra work, but it is necessary to keep your wallets safe. \n Our example repos are all equipped with  .env  support by default, if you want to configure it yourself:  dotenv ,  react-native-dotenv . \n Careful! Before executing this function block! \n Swaps are irreversible! Make sure you are certain with your code, and be extra careful if you happen to run intervals, or any code without human supervision.",
