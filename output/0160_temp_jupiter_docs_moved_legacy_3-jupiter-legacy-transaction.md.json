So you no longer need to do a setup or cleanup transaction. \n Due to transaction size limits, only certain amms can be swapped through together. \n Swap Success / Failure \n :::info  Jupiter Swap Success/Failure Stat \n::: \n \n The typical  swap success rate for Jupiter is 93.7%  excluding failures due to slippage. \n One of the most prominent errors is the UI not limiting the input amount properly resulting in trying to swap with more tokens than the user has available.\n \n The errors for this is  {\"Custom\":1}  from Token Program and  {\"Custom\":40}  from Raydium AMM. \n \n \n {\"Custom\":6000}  is slippage rate failure. \n You may see lower swap success rate if...\n \n You use the SDK and are not limiting the intermediate tokens to the most liquid tokens.  By default, the SDK will use all tokens as intermediary tokens. \n Your trade sizes are very small, < 1 USD. \n In this case the swap route will route through the long tail of token markets which are not very durable and can disappear as another swap takes it. \n But this is generally not a real-world swap.",
