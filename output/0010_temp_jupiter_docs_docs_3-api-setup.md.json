Rate limits range from 1 RPS to 500 RPS plans. \n Ultra Dynamic Rate Limits based on executed swap volume Using Ultra API comes with many benefits  where Jupiter will handle slippage, transaction sending, and more without the need of an RPC from you. With that, the Ultra API is governed by a Dynamic Rate Limit model that will scale with your swap executions. \n \n Payment \n :::note\nRefer to  Payment Method  for more details.\n::: \n :::info Plan Renewal\nThe payment is currently done on a monthly basis, which means you will need to manually renew each month. \n \n 7 days before the plan expires, you will see the state change in the dashboard's table and receive an automated email as a reminder to renew. \n Upon expiry, your key will remain valid for a grace period but will be disabled (but not deleted) when it ends. \n The plan will be renewed to the same plan as the previous. \n If you have any issues with the payment,  please open a ticket .\n::: \n \n The current payment method we support is via Helio. \n \n Only Pro plans require payments. \n The payment is currently done on a monthly basis. \n The payment is done in Solana USDC only.",
