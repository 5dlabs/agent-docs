Perfect for all traders.\ntitle: Verifying Swaps on a Block Explorer \n\n     Verifying Swaps on Solana: A Step-by-Step Guide \n     \n\n :::tip This is a community contributed guide\nThis is a community guide to verifying Jupiter swaps on a Block Explorer, created by  @0xmiir , Marketing Lead at SolanaFM. \n Anyone can contribute a guide to Jupiter Station! Simply send us a PR.\n::: \n When swapping tokens on Solana, you might come across occasional hiccups — sometimes transactions might not go through, a different amount of tokens may appear in your wallet, or the token doesn’t appear at all. How do you figure out what’s going on? \n This guide will walk you through how to verify your swaps on Jupiter. \n :::tip Pro-tip: You can set your Default Explorer\nTo set a Default Explorer, click on the  'settings'  icon in the Jupiter app and set your 'Preferred Explorer'.\n::: \n Viewing Your Swap Transaction \n \n In this scenario, I’ve swapped  0.5SOL  for an estimated  10.08USDC  via  Saber  and  Orca . \n After completing the swap, the status of the swap appears on the bottom left of the interface — Let’s verify the details of the swap using the  SolanaFM Explorer . \n Verifying your Swap \n On SolanaFM, you can verify: \n \n Transaction Failure/Success \n Instructions Executed (The operations taking place within the transactions) \n Movement of tokens (e.g. in and out of your wallet) \n \n Let’s go through these in more detail. \n Transaction Failure/Success \n \n At the top of the transaction interface, you can easily verify the status of the transaction. \n A successful transaction shows “Success”, “Finalized” and “Maximum Confirmations Achieved”, while a failed transaction will show “Error”. \n Instructions Executed \n Instructions within a transaction refer to the operations that have taken place for this transaction to happen successfully. \n \n Here, we can see that the  Jupiter Program  had interacted with the  Saber Stable Swap Program  and the  Orca Whirlpool Program  for the swap to take place. \n Swap 1: 0.25  SOL  → 0.225  stSOL \n Swap 2: 0.225  stSOL  → 5.04  USDC \n Swap 3: 0.25  SOL  → 5.04  USDC \n Movement of Tokens \n The Transaction Flow helps us understand which tokens moved, and how much of each token moved in and out of your wallet accounts. \n \n We’ve seen from the Instructions that 50% of the SOL amount was swapped into stSOL before being converted into USDC (via Saber), while the other 50% was converted directly into USDC (via Orca). \n Movement 1: 0.5 SOL is converted and transferred into a wSOL token account \n Movement 2: 0.25 SOL is converted into 0.2255 stSOL \n Movement 3: 0.2255 stSOL is converted into 5.04 USDC and transferred into the original Sender account \n Movement 4: 0.25 wSOL is converted into 5.04 USDC and transferred into the original Sender account \n Once you confirm the transaction tallies with the details shown on the block explorer, you’re good to go.
