As the Everyday Exchange, you can: \n Access best-priced tokens, quickly. \n You can find newly launched tokens with our Instant Routing feature. New tokens & markets are automatically added to Jupiter Routing. \n Access these tokens at best prices with our performant routing engine,  Metis . We perform the math and give you best prices at Solana speed, at 0 protocol fees. \n Read:  How to Swap \n Access the right tokens, safely. \n You see all important token information (metadata, authorities, verification) and trade conditions such as price impact to help you make an informed swap decision. \n Within Search, we also filter out imposter tokens and duplicates, utilise  community verification  of tokens, and intelligent search using real-time info (liquidity, volume). \n Read:  How to Trade Safely \n Trade frictionlessly, knowing it just works. \n You get an abstracted swap experience with Auto mode by setting your Max Slippage and MEV protection. Jupiter will do the rest by configuring the best transaction fees and slippage based on your trade, heuristics, and market conditions. \n For folks who wants more fine-tuned control e.g. choosing Fixed Slippage to  Dynamic Slippage , we have Manual mode for you. \n Read:  How to Configure Settings \n Last Updated: 4 November 2024",
