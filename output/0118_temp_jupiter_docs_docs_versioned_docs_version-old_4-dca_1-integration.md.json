DCA allows users to receive tokens directly in their wallet as each order is filled! \n This page will serve as a general guide on integrating DCA into your use case. whether you are building a bot for yourself or looking to integrate with existing (d)apps, Jupiter's DCA program will work regardless of programming language used. If you are trying to build a DCA bot in Typescript / Javascript, look at  DCA SDK . \n Address \n DCA Program (mainnet-beta):  DCA265Vj8a9CEuX1eb1LWRnDT7uK6q1xMipnNyatn23M \n Big Picture \n There are 2 key instructions that can be executed \n \n Creating a DCA \n Cancelling (and receiving excess tokens) an existing DCA \n \n Instructions \n 1. Setting up a DCA \n A DCA Account is a Program Derived Address (PDA) account. In order to start dollar cost averaging, you will need to construct and send a Transaction containing an Instruction to open this DCA account.  (if you are not familiar with constructing a transaction on Solana, take a look at using  DCA SDK . This guide provides more thorough code examples) . \n Each DCA account has unique parameters. If you want to have different parameters, you can create any number of DCA accounts. \n Instruction \n pub fn open_dca_v2(\n    ctx: Context<OpenDcaOnBehalf>,\n    application_idx: u64,\n    in_amount: u64,\n    in_amount_per_cycle: u64,\n    cycle_frequency: i64,\n    min_out_amount: Option<u64>,\n    max_out_amount: Option<u64>,\n    start_at: Option<i64>,\n) -> Result<()> {\n \n Arguments needed (in this order): \n Arguments Type Description \n applicationIdx u64 A unix timestamp in seconds \n inAmount u64 Total input mint amount to sell. For e.g. if you are trying to buy SOL using 100 USDC every day over 10 days,  inAmount  should be  100 _ 10 _ (10^6)  - USDC has 6 decimals \n inAmountPerCycle u64 Input mint amount to sell each time. _For e.g. if you are trying to buy SOL using 100 USDC every day over 10 days,  inAmountPerCycle  should be  100 _ (10^6) * \n cycleFrequency i64 The number of seconds between each periodic buys. For e.g. if you are trying to DCA on a daily basis,  cycleFrequency  should be 60 _ 60 _ 24 = 86,400 \n minOutAmount Option<u64> This is an optional field. Following the examples above, let's say you only want to buy SOL if SOL is below SOL-USDC $20, that means for each cycle, with every 100 USDC, you want to receive a minimum of  100 / 20 = 5 SOL . You can then pass  5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL  as argument here. This ensures that you receive > 5 SOL for each order. \n maxOutAmount Option<u64> This is just the inverse scenario of  minOutAmount . While  maxOutAmount  is a little counter intuitive, it can be used by advanced traders / investors who believe an asset is at risk of further decline in prices if it goes beyond a certain threshold. Say in the case of output mint being a stablecoin, if the stablecoin drops to $0.5, you will get more buying into it, but that may not necessary be a good thing since the risk of a stablecoin going to $0 is very real if it could depeg to $0.5. This is where  maxOutAmount  could be useful. \n startAt i64 Unix timestamp in seconds of when you would like DCA to start. Pass  0  if you want to start immediately or pass a future time as a unix timestamp in seconds \n \n Context Accounts needed: \n Accounts Description isSigner? isWritable? \n dca You will need to derive a DCA PDA here. The 4 buffers used to generate the PDA are seed -> 'dca', user public key, input token public key, output token public key and a uid (use a unix timestamp). See  code example  below false true \n user This is the user's pubkey. Needs to be a signer of the transaction. true false \n payer This is the payer's pubkey. Needs to be a signer of the transaction. Pays for the rent to open token accounts needed as well as user's DCA (PDA) account. This can be the same as user. true true \n inputMint Token to sell false false \n outputMint Token to buy false false \n userAta User's token account holding the token to sell. Does not necessarily need to be a associated token account. Will transfer inputMint tokens from this account to DCA PDA's inputMint ATA false true \n inAta The associated token account's address of DCA PDA for inputMint. Example:  getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(inputMint, dcaPubKey, true)  from  @solana/spl-token  library false true \n outAta The associated token account's address of DCA PDA for outputMint. Example:  getAssociatedTokenAddressSync(outputMint, dcaPubKey, true)  from  @solana/spl-token  library false true \n systemProgram The usual  new PublicKey(\"11111111111111111111111111111111\") false false \n tokenProgram new PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA');  DCA has not been tested to work with Token 2022 yet false false \n associatedTokenProgram new PublicKey('ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL'); false false \n eventAuthority new PublicKey('Cspp27eGUDMXxPEdhmEXFVRn6Lt1L7xJyALF3nmnWoBj')  This is DCA Program's event authority for Anchor  0.28.0 's event CPI feature. false false \n program The DCA program itself  new PublicKey('DCA265Vj8a9CEuX1eb1LWRnDT7uK6q1xMipnNyatn23M') false false \n \n Getting a DCA PDA \n const [dca] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(\n  [\n    Buffer.from(\"dca\"),\n    userPubKey.toBuffer(),\n    inTokenPubKey.toBuffer(),\n    outTokenPubKey.toBuffer(),\n    new BN(parseInt((Date.now() / 1000).toString())).toArrayLike(\n      Buffer,\n      \"le\",\n      8\n    ),\n  ],\n  new PublicKey(\"DCA265Vj8a9CEuX1eb1LWRnDT7uK6q1xMipnNyatn23M\")\n);\n \n Phew! That's all that is necessary to construct the instruction. Next, you will need to sign and send the transaction! \n Here's what a successful transaction to create a  DCA account looks like . \n 2. Cancelling a DCA \n If you decide to stop your DCA program, you can close the DCA account. Closing the DCA account also returns any leftover tokens to the owner of the DCA account. \n Similar to opening a DCA account, you will need to send a transaction containing an instruction to  close_dca . \n Closing a DCA is relatively simple. There are no arguments needed. The accounts necessary are \n Accounts needed: \n Accounts Description isSigner? isWritable? \n user This is the user's account that owns the DCA Account. This account will also be the signer and payer of the transaction true true \n dca The DCA account you want to close false true \n inputMint Token to sell false false \n outputMint Token to buy false false \n inAta The associated token account's address of DCA PDA for inputMint.
