You can find more details in  API Setup  and  API Rate Limit  docs.)\n::: \n Payment Method \n We currently support 2 payment methods: \n \n Crypto - USDC on Solana via Helio \n Credit card - USD via CoinFlow \n \n To pay for higher rate limits on Pro plan, you can choose either of the payment methods via the Portal UI. \n Crypto \n Property Details \n Payment The payment is done in Solana USDC only. \n Cadence The payment is currently done on a monthly basis, which means you will need to revisit Portal and manually renew each month. \n Expiry 7 days before the plan expires, you will see the state change in the dashboard's table and receive an automated email as a reminder to renew. Upon expiry, your key will remain valid for a grace period but will be disabled (but not deleted) when it ends. \n Renewal If you choose to \"Renew\", the plan will be renewed to the same plan as the previous month. To change plan, you can upgrade/downgrade your plan at any time and cost will be pro-rated. \n Fee Jupiter incurs the payment service fees. \n Changing of payment method From Crypto to Credit Card: 1. Wait for plan to expire 2. Pay using the credit card payment method. \n \n Credit Card \n Property Details \n Payment The payment is done in USD only. \n Cadence The subscription is automatically renewed and funds deducted on a monthly basis. \n Fee User incurs the credit card payment service fees at 3.4% of the payment amount + $0.25. \n Changing of cards For security, changing of cards require a few extra steps and cannot be done in the middle of the subscription. 1. Cancel current plan 2. Wait for plan to expire 3. Resubscribe a plan with the new card. \n Upgrading of plans You can upgrade your plan at any time. - The cost of the new plan will be charged immediately, while the pro-rated unused cost of the previous plan will be refunded. - The subscription date will be updated to the date of the upgrade. - Do note that the refund will be processed at least 1-2 business days after the upgrade. \n Downgrading of plans You can downgrade by cancelling your plan and subscribing to a lower plan after expiry. \n Cancellation of plans No refund will be given for unused days and the Pro plan will continue until the expected expiry date. \n Changing of payment method From Credit Card to Crypto: 1. Cancel current plan so it does not automatically renew 2. Wait for plan to expire 3. Pay using the crypto payment method. \n Other Caveats - Registered card address must be the billing address. - No usage of disposable cards as payments are made for a recurring subscription plan.",
