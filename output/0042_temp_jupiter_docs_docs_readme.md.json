You'll find detailed API guides, schemas, and powerful tool kits built by the team and DevRel Working Group to help you build with Jupiter. \n :::tip Breaking Changes\nRefer to the  What's New?  section for the latest API updates and breaking changes.\n::: \n Get Started \n For new developers or new to blockchain development : We recommend you to start with the  Environment Setup  and  Development Basics  guides. \n For existing developers : Please refer to the  What's New?  section for the latest API updates and breaking changes. \n For routing integrations : Please refer to the  DEX Integration  and  RFQ Integration  guides to complete the prerequisites before we look into integrating. \n Quick Links  to APIs and Tool Kits: \n \n Ultra API \n Swap API \n Lend API   NEW & BETA! \n Trigger API \n Recurring API \n Token API \n Price API \n Send API   NEW & BETA! \n Studio API   NEW & BETA! \n Jupiter Plugin   REFRESHED! \n Unified Wallet Kit \n \n Reach out to us  on  Discord  for developer support \n \n If you have any feedback. \n If you have technical questions. \n If you need API Portal support. \n Refer to these channels to receive updates:  Telegram channel  or  Discord channel \n \n What's New? \n :::caution Deprecation of Price API V2 and Token API V1\n Last updated: June 2025 \n Price API upgrades to V3  to support more reliable and timely pricing data - derived by the last swap price (across all transactions) and a set of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers. \n Token API upgrades to V2  to support an easier and reliable usage with new data addition such as  Organic Score , more trading categories like toporganicscore, and more. \n :::danger ACTION REQUIRED \n \n If you are using  Price API V2  and  Token API V1 \n Please migrate to their new versions respectively \n The older version will be deprecated by 1 August 2025\n::: \n \n :::caution API Gateway: Improvements\n Last updated: March 2025 \n Improved API Gateway! \n For those that have been using the new hostnames at  api.jup.ag/** , we have made improvements to the infrastructure \n \n Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now \n Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits) \n \n Dual endpoint moving forward. \n We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via https://portal.jup.ag/ \n \n api.jup.ag  will serve only pro/paid users \n lite-api.jup.ag  will be the endpoint to provide free usage \n \n :::danger ACTION REQUIRED\n ACTION REQUIRED (only for free usage) \n \n Migrate to  lite-api.jup.ag   BY 1 MAY 2025 \n The paths remain unchanged, only domain change \n The same rate limits still apply \n You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free \n If you are still on  api.jup.ag  without an API key, you will get a 401 response \n \n NO action required for higher rate limit plans via Portal \n \n Your usage on  api.jup.ag  remains unchanged \n You can only use  api.jup.ag  with an API Key\n::: \n \n :::caution Trigger API: New Hostname and Breaking Changes\n Last updated: March 2025 \n \n The  /limit/v2  path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the  /trigger/v1  path immediately. \n /execute  endpoint is introduced. \n /createOrder  endpoint now includes an additional  requestId  parameter to be used with the  /execute  endpoint. \n /cancelOrder  endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while  /cancelOrders  endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders. \n The  tx  field in the responses are now  transaction  or  transactions . \n /getTriggerOrders  endpoint is introduces a new format to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters). \n Please refer to the documentation for usage . \n \n \n     \n        Hostname Changes\n     \n#### Trigger\n Old Hostnames New Hostnames \n https://api.jup.ag/limit/v2/createOrder https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder \n https://api.jup.ag/limit/v2/executeOrder https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/executeOrder \n https://api.jup.ag/limit/v2/cancelOrder https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrder https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrders \n https://api.jup.ag/limit/v2/openOrders https://api.jup.ag/limit/v2/orderHistory https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/getTriggerOrders \n \n \n:::\n :::caution API Gateway: New Hostnames and API Keys\n Last updated: January 2025 \n \n API will now be served through new hostnames. \n API will now be served through API keys. \n API Keys will be distributed via https://portal.jup.ag (Refer to  API Setup  to get started). \n Old hostnames will be slowly phased out. \n Old hostnames during this period will have reduced rate limits to facilitate migration to the new API. \n \n Service Types Description \n Free with no API key Decreased rate limits to only accommodate for testing. \n Paid plan with API key Fixed rate limits, self served through an API dashboard. \n \n \n     \n        Hostname Changes\n     \n#### Swap\n Old Hostnames New Hostnames \n https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/quote https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote \n https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/swap https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap \n https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/swap-instructions https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap-instructions \n https://quote-api.jup.ag/v6/program-id-to-label https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/program-id-to-label \n \n Price \n Old Hostnames New Hostnames \n https://price.jup.ag/v6 https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2 \n \n Token \n Old Hostnames New Hostnames \n https://tokens.jup.ag/token/:mint https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/token/:mint \n https://tokens.jup.ag/tokens?tags=:tags https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/tagged/:tag \n https://tokens.jup.ag/tokens_with_markets https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/mints/tradable \n \n \n:::",
