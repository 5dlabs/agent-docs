  "content": "Migrating the API or SDK \n Migrating the API \n From v3 to v4 \n \n You do not have to support Versioned Transactions to migrate to v4.  You can set the  parameterasLegacyTransaction=true  to have the api return a legacy swap transaction. \n V3 used Legacy transactions. V4 has migrated to use Versioned Transactions with Address Lookup Tables. \n With  VersionedTransaction  and Address Lookup Tables, all Jupiter swaps are done in a single transaction, so they no longer need to handle sending multiple transactions sequentially. \n Use  VersionedTransaction.deserialize   to deserialize the transaction object in order to insert your own instructions in the transaction. \n V4 swagger: https://quote-api.jup.ag/v4/docs/static/index.html \n \n From v1 to v3 \n \n Remove token ledger \n Change  slippage  to  slippageBps \n Route now return  slippageBps \n V1 swagger : https://quote-api.jup.ag/docs/static/index.html \n V3 swagger: https://quote-api.jup.ag/v3/docs/static/index.html \n \n Migrating the SDK \n From v2 to v3 \n \n slippageBps  instead of  slippage \n \n slippageBps  = Math.ceil(slippage*100) \n \n \n Remove the need of token ledger \n Example: https://github.com/jup-ag/jupiter-core-example/commit/1f6967e46736b52ba9b4d7a85f91d2628e3d0e26 \n \n From v1 to v2 \n \n jupiter.computeRoutes ,  inputAmount  changed to  amount  and the typing is changed from number to JSBI. (https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi)\n \n The result of  computeRoutes  also return JSBI like  inAmount  and  outAmount . \n \n \n outAmountWithSlippage  changed to  otherAmountThreshold \n Example: https://github.com/jup-ag/jupiter-nextjs-example/commit/ff91a085f129d34cf83b14b1fda62ef370d7f1a9",
