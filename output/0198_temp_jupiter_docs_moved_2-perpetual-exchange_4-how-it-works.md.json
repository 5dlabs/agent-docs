  "content": "sidebar_label: \"How It Works\"\ndescription: Key Concepts of Perpetual Exchange \n How It Works \n Overview \n Jupiter Perps is a LP-based perpetual exchange based on oracle prices. \n Our pool consists of 5 tokens, SOL, ETH, WBTC, USDC, and USDT. Users acquire JLP by swapping on  Jupiter Swap . Jupiter Swap automatically finds the cheapest way of acquiring JLP, by swapping to the desired asset and depositing that, or purchasing off the market. \n Traders open leveraged positions by putting up collateral and borrowing\nthe rest of the position from the pool. \n For Traders \n Example Trade \n For example, a trader opens a 2x long SOL position at a position size of $100\nUSD by depositing $50 USD worth of SOL as collateral and borrowing $50 USD\nworth of SOL from the pool. \n Suppose the SOL price is up 20% when the position is closed. Assuming 0 fees,\nthe position will have gained $20 USD. The trader will receive $70 USD (50 + 20)\nworth of SOL tokens and the rest of the tokens are returned to the pool. \n Suppose instead that the SOL price is down 20% when the position is closed.\nAssuming 0 fees, the position will have lost $20 USD. The trader will receive\n$30 USD (50 - 20) worth of SOL tokens and the pool will get the remaining\ntokens. \n To open a long position, a trader deposits collateral matching the underlying\nasset. For example, to open long SOL-USD position, the trader deposits SOL. \n Conversely, to open a short position, a trader deposits collateral matching one\nof the stablecoins in the pool. \n Leverage \n To allow for leverage, traders borrow assets from the pool to create a\nlarger position. To create a 2x long position SOL-USD, the other 1x SOL will be\nborrowed from the pool. \n This borrow leads to a hourly borrow rate to be paid to the pool. Positions always pay borrow fees and are never paid funding. \n Hourly Borrow Rate \n Traders pay an hourly borrow fee to the pool based on the hourly borrow rate, position size, and\ntoken utilization percentage. This is computed for each token that a trader borrows. \n hourly borrow fee = tokens borrowed/tokens in the pool * hourly borrow rate * position size \n For example, suppose SOL is at 50% utilization and assuming an hourly funding\nrate of 0.01%. Then a trader with a long position SOL-USD of size 1000 USD will\naccumulate funding fees at a rate of 0.05 USD per hour. \n Auto Closing Positions that Exceed Maximum Leverage \n The maximum allowed leverage is 200x. \n Positions where the trader's collateral less fees and less unrealized losses is less than 0.5% of the position size will be liquidated. \n Extra fund from position closure will be returned to the trader automatically. \n Oracle \n Jupiter Perps always use Pyth oracles on the trading prices and chart data. However, there are 2 types of Pyth oracles, the  mainnet-beta  oracle and the  pythnet  oracle. \n For position changes, such as opening, closing or liquidating positions, keeper bots utilize Pyth's mainnet-beta prices. In times of congestion, they will use the backup Pythnet oracles. This improves reliability for traders to adjust their positions. \n For chart data, we are using the Pyth  Hermes  web service. The Hermes web service is using the prices from Pythnet. There might be slight deviations between the chart and your execution prices occasionally, due to the small variation between  mainnet-beta  and  pythnet  prices. \n You can check out the SOL/USD mainnet-beta oracle  here  and the SOL/USD pythnet oracle  here . \n You can also utilize  Pyth Benchmarks  to check the oracle price for any of Pyth's listed tokens at any timestamp. Use this to independently verify historical oracle prices.",
