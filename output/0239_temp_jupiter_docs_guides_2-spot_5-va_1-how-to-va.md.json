It works similarly by making contributions in a consistent time period but differs by the amount of each contribution. VA focuses on equal growth of the portfolio instead of equal investments. \n VA features the ability to react to market volatility and price action, in short, buying more tokens when price is low and buying less tokens when price is high. Check out this  Explainer Page  to learn more about VA. \n Basic VA User Flow \n \n First, navigate to the  Jupiter Website  and then click on the  VA  icon below the top navigation bar.  Double check  that the URL in your search bar is correct: https://jup.ag/va/ \n Next, connect your wallet by clicking the  Connect Wallet  button in the upper right corner of the site. \n Set the Amount  (Increase Portfolio Value By)  and the Duration  (Every)  for the VA orders.\n Do note  that the amount is based on how much of the total you want to increase by and not how much each contribution is \n Select the token you want to buy and the token you are allocating  (Max Budget)  on the VA terminal. \n Select between to Start Now or place the order in the future through Start At. \n Select between to auto receive the bought tokens in your account or manually claim it. \n Double check the order Summary details and if things look good, click the  Place Order  button. \n Confirm the wallet notification and the VA order will be submitted to the system. \n A notification toast will appear in the lower left corner that will notify the user once the transaction has been sent and has completed. \n Your new VA order will populate the Active VAs section below the Terminal once it is confirmed and the UI updates. \n You can expand the Active VAs and inspect the progress of each VA, or view previously completed VAs in Past VAs. \n \n Let's go through the VA Settings in more detail below. \n \n Jupiter VA Settings \n \n \n VA:  Select the VA tab in the product navigation menu to arrive at the VA terminal. \n Amount:  Specify the total value where your portfolio will increase by. \n Duration:  Specify the time frequency for the VA order with a numerical input and the dropdown selector. \n Output Token Selector:  Select the token that you are looking to buy. \n Input Token Selector:  Select the token you want to allocate or spend in your VA order. \n Input Field:  Enter the amount of the input tokens you want to allocate or spend in your VA order. \n Start Date:  Select between to start your VA order now or in the future. \n Receive Method:  Select between to automatically receive in your account or manually claim it after every buy. \n Backtest Result Summary:  A summary is provided based on your inputs and historical data to calculate how much you would have spent and earned in a period. \n Backtest Result Values:  A breakdown of the backtest result summary:\n \n Average Price -
