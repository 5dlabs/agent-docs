Unlike traditional markets with centralized pricing mechanisms and consistent liquidity, decentralized finance (DeFi) presents a set of dynamic and often adversarial conditions. The Price API V3 is built with these realities in mind, abstracting away challenges to deliver accurate, real-time token prices with integrity and consistency. \n Challenge Description \n Gamification of Price In decentralized environments, token prices can be manipulated or \"gamed\" for appearances or exploitative purposes. Common patterns include: Wash trading to inflate volume or imply activity Circular swaps to fabricate higher valuations \n Fragmented, Volatile or Imbalanced Liquidity Across Venues Liquidity on Solana (and other chains) is spread across numerous protocols and AMMs. No single source can represent the entire market. Different pools might have wildly different pricing and can change very quickly. \n Low Liquidity Tokens Some tokens trade rarely or only within shallow pools. In such cases, even small orders can cause large price swings, making pricing unreliable. \n \n \n How Price is Derived \n The latest version of Price API is V3 - which uses the  last swapped price (across all transactions) . The swaps are priced by working outwards from a small set of reliable tokens (like SOL) whose price we get from external oracle sources. \n While and also after deriving the last swap price, we also utilize a number of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers: \n \n Asset origin and launch method \n Market liquidity metrics \n Market behaviour patterns \n Holder distribution statistics \n Trading activity indicators \n Market value to liquidity ratios \n \n :::caution\nWhen using Price API, do note that you may face many tokens where price is not available or returns null. \n This is because, we use the aforementioned heuristics to determine the price of a token and if the price is reliable - if certain combinations of these factors indicate potential issues with price reliability or market health, the token will be flagged and not provided a price. \n This is to safeguard users and prevent an inaccurate price from being returned.\n:::",
