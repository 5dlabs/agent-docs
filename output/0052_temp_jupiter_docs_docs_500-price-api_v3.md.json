The simplified format allows easy integration while letting Jupiter handle the complexity of ensuring the accuracy of the provided prices. \n :::note \n \n Lite URL:  https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v3 \n Pro URL:  https://api.jup.ag/price/v3 \n \n To upgrade to Pro or understand our rate limiting, please refer to this section. \n \n API Key Setup \n API Rate Limit \n::: \n \n :::info\nThis is in Beta and subject to changes, if you need help please reach out to us in  Discord \n::: \n How Price is Derived \n Price API V3 price tokens by using the  last swapped price (across all transactions) . The swaps are priced by working outwards from a small set of reliable tokens (like SOL) whose price we get from external oracle sources. \n While and also after deriving the last swap price, we also utilize a number of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers: \n \n Asset origin and launch method \n Market liquidity metrics \n Market behaviour patterns \n Holder distribution statistics \n Trading activity indicators \n Organic Score \n \n Get Price \n Simply request via the base URL with the query parameters of your desired mint addresses. You can also comma-separate them to request for multiple prices. \n const price = await (\n    await fetch(\n        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v3?ids=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112,JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN'\n    )\n).json();\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(price, null, 2));\n \n Price Response \n Here is the sample response, notice a few details here: \n \n The  usdPrice  is the only price. \n The  decimals  response is helpful to display price information on the UI. \n The  blockId  can be used to verify the recency of the price. \n \n {\n  \"JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN\": {\n    \"usdPrice\": 0.4056018512541055,\n    \"blockId\": 348004026,\n    \"decimals\": 6,\n    \"priceChange24h\": 0.5292887924920519\n  },\n  \"So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\": {\n    \"usdPrice\": 147.4789340738336,\n    \"blockId\": 348004023,\n    \"decimals\": 9,\n    \"priceChange24h\": 1.2907622140620008\n  }\n}\n \n Limitations \n Query limits \n \n You can query up to 50  ids  at once. \n \n If the price of a token cannot be found \n \n Typically, it is likely that the token has not been traded recently - in the last 7 days. \n Additionally, we also use the aforementioned heuristics to determine the price of a token and if the price is reliable - if certain combinations of these factors indicate potential issues with price reliability or market health, the token will be flagged and not provided a price. \n The token is flagged as suspicious and this can be cross referenced with the Token API V2's  audit.isSus  field. \n \n V2 had more information \n \n Yes V2 had more information, however, we think that it is not the best representation of price and it also caused different interpretations of price across the different platforms. \n With Price API V3, we are handling the complexities to ensure price accuracy and elimate outliers  using the heuristics as mentioned above , so there will only be one stable and accurate price source for all. \n If you require more information like Price API V2, you can use the  /quote  endpoint of the Swap API to derive those data ( you can refer to this post about how Price API V2 is derived ).",
