Please read  API Setup  and  API Rate Limit  docs as well. \n Does Lite or Ultra plan need payment? \n \n No, you do not need to pay for Lite or Ultra. \n For Lite, just request directly to  lite-api.jup.ag  without an API Key. \n For Ultra, you will need to log in first to generate an API Key and use it with  api.jup.ag/ultra \n \n Does Pro plan have any advantages from Lite? \n \n By purchasing a Pro plan, you are only accessing higher rate limits with no differences in usage nor freshness of data. \n \n Can I use the same API key for all Jupiter APIs? \n \n Yes, API keys are universal across both Fixed Rate Limit and Dynamic Rate Limit system. \n \n Does the API Key apply immeidately? \n \n No, it will take 2-5 minutes for it to reflect. \n \n What happens if I upgrade/downgrade my plan? \n \n You can only upgrade/downgrade your Pro plan. \n The amount payable is pro-rated. \n Upgrade happens immediately (2 - 5 minutes) is still required to be reflected. \n Downgrade will happen at the end of the billing period if you are to renew the plan. \n \n Can I use both Pro and Ultra APIs together? \n \n Yes. You can maintain a Pro subscription for all other API routes while integrating Ultra endpoints separately. \n Do note that purchasing a Pro plan, does not apply its rate limits to Ultra API. \n \n For more support! \n \n Please reach out to us. \n If you have increasing demand and growth in your app, and need custom rate limits or payment options beyond the provided in Portal. \n If you require higher base quota for Ultra plan to bootstrap your product. \n If you have questions or need support on Portal,  open a ticket . \n Join the  Telegram channel  or  Discord channel  to subscribe to updates.",
