Utilizing LP pool liquidity and oracles, it ensures zero price impact, zero slippage, and deep liquidity. Oracles enable stable market operations during liquidations and stop-loss events, removing risks of position bankruptcy and LP pool fund loss. Users can open and close positions in one simple step, eliminating the need for additional accounts or deposits. With the Jupiter Swap integration, any Solana token can be used to open positions. \n The LP pool is also integrated into Jupiter to provide liquidity to the overall Solana ecosystem.
