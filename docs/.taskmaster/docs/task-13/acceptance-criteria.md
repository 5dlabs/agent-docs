# Acceptance Criteria: Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

## Functional Requirements
- [ ] Helm chart structure created and configured
- [ ] Resource limits and requests properly defined
- [ ] Security policies implemented and enforced
- [ ] High availability configuration complete
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies functional

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete Helm chart with values.yaml
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress)
- [ ] ConfigMap and Secret management
- [ ] Documentation and deployment guides

## Validation (4-step mandatory)
1. GitHub push triggers build
2. CI builds container and runs clippy/tests
3. Deploy via Helm to Kubernetes
4. Real-world validation against MCP client### NFR-0: Code Quality and Automation
- [ ] After adding any new function, run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and fix all warnings before continuing
- [ ] Prior to submission, ensure `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` all pass locally
- [ ] All changes pushed to a feature branch; GitHub Actions must complete successfully (including deployment) before opening a PR
- [ ] PR creation is gated on a green CI pipeline and successful deployment of the server artifact
