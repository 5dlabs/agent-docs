## Success Metrics

- 100% of public APIs documented with examples
- OpenAPI specification enables successful client generation
- Kubernetes deployment success rate > 95% following guide
- Client integration success rate > 90% for new users
- Documentation completeness score > 95% via automated analysis
- User satisfaction rating > 4.5/5 for documentation quality
- Time to productive use < 30 minutes for new developers
- Documentation maintenance overhead < 10% of development time### NFR-0: Code Quality and Automation
- [ ] After adding any new function, run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and fix all warnings before continuing
- [ ] Prior to submission, ensure `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` all pass locally
- [ ] All changes pushed to a feature branch; GitHub Actions must complete successfully (including deployment) before opening a PR
- [ ] PR creation is gated on a green CI pipeline and successful deployment of the server artifact
