# Task ID: 1
# Title: Comprehensive System Assessment and Migration Planning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a thorough evaluation of the existing Doc Server codebase, infrastructure, and database state. Identify gaps between current implementation and production requirements, particularly focusing on MCP transport migration needs.
# Details:
Analyze existing Rust crates structure (database, mcp, embeddings, doc-loader, llm), verify database migration status, test existing rust_query tool functionality, examine current HTTP/SSE implementation against Streamable HTTP requirements (MCP 2025-06-18), validate Kubernetes deployment configuration in .github/workflows/deploy-doc-server.yml, check PostgreSQL cluster connectivity with pgvector extension, and document all findings with specific migration requirements. Use cargo test to validate existing test suite, examine transport.rs placeholder for implementation needs.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive system tests including database connectivity tests, MCP server health checks, rust_query tool integration tests, GitHub Actions workflow dry runs, and document all test results in a system assessment report. Validate against production Kubernetes cluster accessibility.
