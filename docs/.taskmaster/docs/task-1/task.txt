# Task ID: 1
# Title: Comprehensive System Assessment and Migration Planning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a thorough evaluation of the existing Doc Server codebase, infrastructure, and database state. Identify gaps between current implementation and production requirements, particularly focusing on MCP transport migration needs.
# Details:
Analyze existing Rust crates structure (database, mcp, embeddings, doc-loader, llm), verify database migration status, test existing rust_query tool functionality, examine current HTTP/SSE implementation against Streamable HTTP requirements (MCP 2025-06-18), validate Kubernetes deployment configuration in .github/workflows/deploy-doc-server.yml, check PostgreSQL cluster connectivity with pgvector extension, and document all findings with specific migration requirements. Use cargo test to validate existing test suite, examine transport.rs placeholder for implementation needs.

Environment Configuration:
The project uses requirements.yaml file to define environment variables and secrets for Kubernetes deployment. Key environment variables that must be configured include:
- VECTOR_DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the main PostgreSQL database 
- OPENAI_API_KEY: API key for OpenAI embedding service
Additional configuration is defined in requirements.yaml including rate limiting, batch processing settings, and monitoring parameters.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive system tests including database connectivity tests, MCP server health checks, rust_query tool integration tests, GitHub Actions workflow dry runs, and document all test results in a system assessment report. Validate against production Kubernetes cluster accessibility.
