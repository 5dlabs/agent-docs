# Task 16: Basic Performance Validation for Small User Base

## Overview
Validate performance for a single-user environment (5–6 agents). Focus on correctness and baseline latency without heavy load or complex scaling.

## Implementation Guide
- Establish baseline latency for key operations (query, embedding, transport)
- Verify in-memory session/caching suffices; no Redis required at this stage
- Ensure connection keep-alive and timeouts behave under light concurrency
- Validate DB pool sizing for light use (e.g., 5–10 connections)
- Profile slow paths and capture actionable follow-ups

## Success Metrics
- P50/P95 query latency within targets (< 500ms / < 2s)
- Stable behavior with 5–6 concurrent agents
- No connection leaks or timeouts during 30-minute sessions
- DB pool saturation does not occur under expected usage
