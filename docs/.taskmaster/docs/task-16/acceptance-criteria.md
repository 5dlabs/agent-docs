## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Integration Testing with Database
**Given**: Code changes requiring database interaction
**When**: Integration test stage executes
**Then**:
- PostgreSQL container starts successfully
- Database fixtures load without errors
- All MCP tool integration tests pass
- Database connections properly managed
- Test cleanup completes successfully

### Test Case 2: Security Vulnerability Detection
**Given**: Dependency with known CRITICAL vulnerability
**When**: Security scanning stage executes
**Then**:
- cargo-audit detects vulnerability
- Pipeline fails at security scanning stage
- Vulnerability report generated with details
- Deployment blocked until vulnerability resolved
- Security team notification sent

### Test Case 3: Performance Regression Detection
**Given**: Code changes that degrade performance by >10%
**When**: Performance testing stage executes
**Then**:
- Performance regression detected automatically
- Comparison report generated with baseline
- Pipeline fails with performance alert
- Development team notified of regression
- Deployment blocked until performance restored

### Test Case 4: Blue-Green Deployment Success
**Given**: Successful pipeline with all tests passing
**When**: Blue-green deployment stage executes
**Then**:
- Green environment deployed successfully
- Health checks pass for new deployment
- Traffic switched from blue to green
- Blue environment kept for rollback capability
- Deployment success notification sent

### Test Case 5: Deployment Rollback Automation
**Given**: Deployment with failing health checks
**When**: Smoke tests detect failures
**Then**:
- Automated rollback initiated within 30 seconds
- Traffic switched back to previous version
- Failed deployment environment cleaned up
- Rollback success confirmed via monitoring
- Incident notification sent to team

### Test Case 6: Pipeline Performance Optimization
**Given**: Complete CI/CD pipeline execution
**When**: All stages run in parallel where possible
**Then**:
- Total execution time under 10 minutes
- Security and integration tests run concurrently
- Deployment preparation paralleled with testing
- Resource utilization optimized
- Pipeline efficiency metrics collected

## Validation Criteria

### Automated Pipeline Testing
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow validation
name: Pipeline Validation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Validate workflow syntax
