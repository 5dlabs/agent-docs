# Task 7: OpenAI Embedding Client with Batch Processing

## Overview
Implement optimized OpenAI embedding generation using text-embedding-3-large model with batch processing for 50% cost reduction.

## Implementation Guide
- Implement OpenAI Batch API integration with JSONL format
- Configure text-embedding-3-large with 3072 or 1024 dimensions
- Create batch queue system for 20,000 line chunks
- Implement rate limiting (3000 RPM / 1M TPM) with token bucket
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement cost tracking and reporting system

## Technical Requirements
- OpenAI Batch API integration
- JSONL format batch processing
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Cost tracking and 50% reduction validation
- Secure API key management

## Success Metrics
- 50% cost reduction through batch processing
- Rate limiting compliance (3000 RPM / 1M TPM)
- Processing time < 20 minutes for 20k embeddings
- Retry mechanism handles failures gracefully
- Cost tracking accurate and comprehensive
