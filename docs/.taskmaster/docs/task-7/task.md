# Task 7: Database Migration and Schema Optimization

## Overview
Optimize PostgreSQL database schema and implement migration system for production deployment with performance improvements.

## Implementation Guide
- Create database migration system with version tracking
- Optimize schema for vector search performance  
- Add proper indexing strategies for document retrieval
- Implement connection pooling optimization
- Add database health monitoring and metrics
- Document pgvector 2000-dimension index limitation; plan for either dimension reduction or future pgvector upgrade to enable vector index

## Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Migration versioning and rollback capability
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Connection pool configuration
- Database monitoring integration

## Notes from Assessment
- Current embeddings are 3072-dim (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large); vector index cannot be created
- Queries must rely on metadata filters + full scan similarity; performance workarounds required

## Success Metrics
- Query performance improvements (< 2s response time)
- Successful schema migrations without data loss
- Optimized connection pooling for concurrent access
- Database health monitoring operational
- Backup and recovery procedures validated
