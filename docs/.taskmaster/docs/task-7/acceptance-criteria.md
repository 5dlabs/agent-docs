# Acceptance Criteria: Database Migration and Schema Optimization

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Migration System
- [ ] Version-controlled database migrations
- [ ] Forward migration execution  
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed migrations
- [ ] Migration history tracking
- [ ] Atomic migration operations

### FR-2: Schema Optimization
- [ ] Optimized indexes for vector search
- [ ] Proper foreign key constraints
- [ ] Optimized data types for storage efficiency
- [ ] Partitioning strategy for large datasets
- [ ] Archive strategy for old data

### FR-3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Query execution time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Optimized connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Database configuration tuning
- [ ] Index usage optimization
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Test Cases

### TC-1: Migration Execution
**Given**: New migration available
**When**: Migration executed
**Then**: Schema updated successfully
**And**: Migration recorded in history
**And**: No data loss occurs

### TC-2: Performance Validation
**Given**: Optimized database configuration
**When**: Query performance tested
**Then**: Response time < 2 seconds
**And**: Connection pool efficiency validated
**And**: Resource usage within limits

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete migration framework
- [ ] Optimized database schema
- [ ] Performance tuning configuration
- [ ] Monitoring integration
- [ ] Migration documentation### NFR-0: Code Quality and Automation
- [ ] After adding any new function, run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and fix all warnings before continuing
- [ ] Prior to submission, ensure `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` all pass locally
- [ ] All changes pushed to a feature branch; GitHub Actions must complete successfully (including deployment) before opening a PR
- [ ] PR creation is gated on a green CI pipeline and successful deployment of the server artifact
