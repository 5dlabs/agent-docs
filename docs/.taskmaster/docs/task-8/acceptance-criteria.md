# Acceptance Criteria: OpenAI Embedding Client with Batch Processing

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Batch API Integration
- [ ] JSONL format batch file generation
- [ ] Batch submission to OpenAI Batch API
- [ ] Batch status monitoring and completion handling
- [ ] Result retrieval and processing
- [ ] Support for 20,000 line chunks

### FR-2: Rate Limiting Implementation
- [ ] Token bucket algorithm for 3000 RPM limit
- [ ] Token consumption based on request content
- [ ] 1M TPM (tokens per minute) tracking
- [ ] Async wait mechanism when limits exceeded
- [ ] Burst capacity handling

### FR-3: Cost Tracking and Optimization
- [ ] Cost calculation for batch vs individual requests
- [ ] ~70% cost reduction validation (baseline vs batched)
- [ ] Usage reporting and analytics
- [ ] Cost threshold alerts
- [ ] Detailed cost breakdown by batch

## Test Cases

### TC-1: Batch Processing
**Given**: Large dataset for embedding generation
**When**: Batch processing initiated
**Then**: Data chunked into 20,000 line batches
**And**: JSONL files generated correctly
**And**: Batches submitted to OpenAI API
**And**: Processing completes within time limits

### TC-2: Cost Reduction Validation
**Given**: Batch processing vs individual requests
**When**: Cost analysis performed
**Then**: ~70% cost reduction achieved
**And**: Cost tracking accurate
**And**: Savings properly calculated and reported

## Deliverables
- [ ] Complete OpenAI Batch API client
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Batch queue management system
- [ ] Cost tracking and reporting
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite### NFR-0: Code Quality and Automation
- [ ] After adding any new function, run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and fix all warnings before continuing
- [ ] Prior to submission, ensure `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` all pass locally
- [ ] All changes pushed to a feature branch; GitHub Actions must complete successfully (including deployment) before opening a PR
- [ ] PR creation is gated on a green CI pipeline and successful deployment of the server artifact
