# Task 17: Backup and Recovery System

## Overview
Implement comprehensive backup and recovery system for data protection and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Implementation Guide
- Configure automated database backups
- Implement backup verification and testing
- Create disaster recovery procedures
- Add backup monitoring and alerting
- Test recovery procedures and timing

## Success Metrics
- Automated backups running successfully
- Backup integrity verified regularly
- Recovery procedures tested and documented
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) met
- Data protection compliance achieved## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
