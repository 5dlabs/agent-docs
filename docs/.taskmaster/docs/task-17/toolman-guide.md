## Task-Specific Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Rust Security Audit
        uses: actions-rs/audit@v1
      - name: Cargo Deny
        uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v1

  performance-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Performance Benchmarks
        run: cargo bench --output-format json > bench_results.json
      - name: Compare Performance
        run: ./scripts/compare_performance.sh

  deploy:
    needs: [test, security-scan, performance-test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Blue-Green Deploy
        run: ./scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh
```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh

NAMESPACE="production"
APP_NAME="doc-server"
NEW_VERSION=$1

# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/green-deployment.yaml
kubectl set image deployment/${APP_NAME}-green ${APP_NAME}=${APP_NAME}:${NEW_VERSION} -n ${NAMESPACE}

# Wait for deployment to be ready
kubectl rollout status deployment/${APP_NAME}-green -n ${NAMESPACE} --timeout=300s

# Run health checks
if ./scripts/health_check.sh green; then
    # Switch traffic to green
    kubectl patch service ${APP_NAME} -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}' -n ${NAMESPACE}
    echo "Deployment successful, traffic switched to green"

    # Scale down blue environment
    kubectl scale deployment ${APP_NAME}-blue --replicas=0 -n ${NAMESPACE}
else
    echo "Health checks failed, keeping blue environment"
    kubectl delete deployment ${APP_NAME}-green -n ${NAMESPACE}
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Comprehensive Smoke Tests

```rust
// tests/smoke_tests.rs
use reqwest::Client;
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_health_endpoint() {
    let client = Client::new();
    let response = client
        .get("http://doc-server:8080/health")
        .send()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to send request");

    assert_eq!(response.status(), 200);
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_mcp_tool_functionality() {
    let client = Client::new();
    let response = client
        .post("http://doc-server:8080/mcp")
        .json(&json!({
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "tools/call",
            "params": {
                "name": "rust_query",
                "arguments": {
                    "query": "async fn",
                    "limit": 5
                }
            },
            "id": 1
        }))
        .send()
        .await
        .expect("Failed to send request");

    assert_eq!(response.status(), 200);
    let body: serde_json::Value = response.json().await.unwrap();
    assert!(body["result"]["content"].is_array());
}
```

### 4. Security Scanning Configuration

```toml
# .cargo/deny.toml
[advisories]
db-path = "~/.cargo/advisory-db"
db-urls = ["https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db"]
vulnerability = "deny"
unmaintained = "warn"
yanked = "warn"
notice = "warn"

[licenses]
unlicensed = "deny"
allow = [
    "MIT",
    "Apache-2.0",
    "Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception",
    "BSD-2-Clause",
    "BSD-3-Clause",
    "ISC",
    "Unicode-DFS-2016",
]
deny = [
    "GPL-2.0",
    "GPL-3.0",
    "AGPL-3.0",
]

[bans]
multiple-versions = "warn"
wildcards = "allow"
```

### 5. Performance Regression Detection

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/compare_performance.sh

BASELINE_FILE="baseline_performance.json"
CURRENT_FILE="bench_results.json"
THRESHOLD=10  # 10% regression threshold

if [ ! -f "$BASELINE_FILE" ]; then
    echo "No baseline found, creating baseline from current results"
    cp "$CURRENT_FILE" "$BASELINE_FILE"
    exit 0
fi

# Compare performance metrics
python3 scripts/performance_comparison.py \
    --baseline "$BASELINE_FILE" \
    --current "$CURRENT_FILE" \
    --threshold $THRESHOLD

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Performance regression detected!"
    exit 1
fi
```
