## Test Cases

### TC-1: Session Creation and Header Handling
**Scenario**: Client makes request without session ID
**Given**: MCP server with session management enabled
**When**: Request sent to `/mcp` without `Mcp-Session-Id` header
**Then**: New session created with secure UUID v4 ID
**And**: Response includes `Mcp-Session-Id` header with new session ID
**And**: Session stored in session manager with proper TTL
**And**: Session creation logged with appropriate details

### TC-2: Session Retrieval and Activity Tracking
**Scenario**: Client makes request with existing session ID
**Given**: Client has valid session ID from previous request
**When**: Request sent with `Mcp-Session-Id` header containing valid UUID
**Then**: Existing session retrieved and validated
**And**: Session `last_accessed` timestamp updated
**And**: Response includes same session ID in header
**And**: Session activity logged for monitoring

### TC-3: Session Expiry and Cleanup
**Scenario**: Session expires due to inactivity
**Given**: Session created with 5-minute TTL
**When**: No requests made for 6 minutes
**And**: Background cleanup task runs
**Then**: Expired session removed from storage
**And**: Subsequent request with expired session ID creates new session
**And**: Cleanup operation logged with removed session count

### TC-4: Origin Validation Security
**Scenario**: Request with invalid origin header
**Given**: Server configured with localhost-only origin validation
**When**: Request sent with `Origin: http://malicious-site.com`
**Then**: Request blocked with 403 Forbidden status
**And**: Security violation logged with origin details
**And**: No session created or updated
**And**: Response includes security error message

### TC-5: DNS Rebinding Protection
**Scenario**: DNS rebinding attack attempt
**Given**: Server running on localhost with Host validation
**When**: Request sent with `Host: attacker.com` but connecting to localhost
**Then**: Request blocked with 403 Forbidden status
**And**: DNS rebinding attempt logged as security event
**And**: No server processing of request content
**And**: Connection terminated cleanly

### TC-6: Concurrent Session Handling
**Scenario**: Multiple concurrent requests with different sessions
**Given**: 100 clients with different session IDs making simultaneous requests
**When**: All clients send requests within 1-second window
**Then**: All sessions handled independently without data corruption
**And**: No session ID collisions occur
**And**: Performance remains within acceptable limits
**And**: All responses include correct session IDs

### TC-7: Session Limit Enforcement
**Scenario**: Session creation when at maximum limit
**Given**: Server configured with maximum 10 sessions
**And**: 10 active sessions already exist
**When**: New client attempts to create session
**Then**: Session creation fails with appropriate error
**And**: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status returned
**And**: Error logged with session limit details
**And**: Existing sessions remain unaffected

### TC-8: DELETE Session Termination
**Scenario**: Explicit session termination
**Given**: Client with active session
**When**: DELETE request sent to `/mcp` with session ID
**Then**: Session removed from storage immediately
**And**: HTTP 204 No Content status returned
**And**: Session deletion logged
**And**: Subsequent requests with same session ID create new session

### TC-9: Malformed Session ID Handling
**Scenario**: Request with invalid session ID format
**Given**: Client sends request with malformed session ID
**When**: `Mcp-Session-Id` header contains non-UUID value
**Then**: Invalid session ID ignored gracefully
**And**: New session created automatically
**And**: Invalid format logged as warning
**And**: Response includes new valid session ID

### TC-10: Security Configuration Validation
**Scenario**: Server startup with security configuration
**Given**: Security configuration with custom allowed origins
**When**: Server starts with configuration validation
**Then**: Configuration validated and applied successfully
**And**: Security settings logged at startup
**And**: Origin validation works according to configuration
**And**: Invalid configuration prevents server startup
