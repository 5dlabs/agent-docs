# Task ID: 3
# Title: Session Management and Security Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement robust session management with Mcp-Session-Id headers and comprehensive security measures including Origin header validation and DNS rebinding protection.
# Details:
Generate cryptographically secure session IDs using UUID v4 with proper entropy. Implement Mcp-Session-Id header handling in both requests and responses. Add session storage using in-memory HashMap with TTL support (consider Redis for production scaling). Validate Origin headers to prevent DNS rebinding attacks. Ensure localhost binding (127.0.0.1) for local deployments. Implement session expiry with HTTP 404 responses. Add DELETE endpoint support for explicit session termination. Use chrono for timestamp management and uuid crate for ID generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test session creation during initialization, header propagation across requests, session expiry and cleanup, Origin header validation with various attack vectors, concurrent session handling, and proper error responses for invalid sessions. Validate security measures with penetration testing tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Session Module and Data Structures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a dedicated session management module with secure UUID v4 generation and session data structures including TTL support
### Details:
Create a new `session.rs` module in `/crates/mcp/src/` that defines the Session struct with fields for session_id (UUID v4), created_at (DateTime<Utc>), last_accessed (DateTime<Utc>), ttl (Duration), and associated client data. Implement session ID generation using the uuid crate with proper v4 entropy. Create a SessionManager struct that wraps a thread-safe HashMap (Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Session>>>) for in-memory storage. Add methods for create_session(), get_session(), update_last_accessed(), and cleanup_expired_sessions(). Include a comment noting Redis as a future production scaling option.

## 2. Implement Security Validation Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Origin header validation and DNS rebinding protection with localhost binding enforcement for local deployments
### Details:
Create a `security.rs` module in `/crates/mcp/src/` implementing middleware for Origin header validation. Define allowed origins configuration (defaulting to localhost variants). Implement validate_origin() function that checks incoming Origin headers against allowed list and prevents DNS rebinding attacks. Add localhost binding validation in http_server.rs to ensure server binds to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 for local deployments. Create security configuration struct with options for strict mode, allowed origins list, and custom validation rules. Integrate security checks as Axum middleware layer.

## 3. Add Mcp-Session-Id Header Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement bidirectional Mcp-Session-Id header processing in HTTP requests and responses following MCP specification
### Details:
Modify the SSE handler in transport.rs to extract Mcp-Session-Id from request headers and validate session existence. Update mcp_handler in server.rs to check for session headers and attach to response. Implement session propagation through the request lifecycle using Axum's State and Extension mechanisms. Add header injection in all HTTP responses including SSE streams. Handle missing session scenarios by creating new sessions during initialization. Ensure proper header casing (Mcp-Session-Id) per MCP spec.

## 4. Implement Session Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Add session expiry handling with HTTP 404 responses and DELETE endpoint for explicit session termination
### Details:
Implement background task using tokio::spawn for periodic session cleanup based on TTL. Add session expiry check middleware that returns HTTP 404 for expired sessions before processing requests. Create DELETE /session/{id} endpoint in server.rs for explicit session termination. Implement graceful cleanup of associated resources when sessions expire or are deleted. Add session renewal logic on valid requests to update last_accessed timestamp. Configure default TTL (30 minutes) with environment variable override option.

## 5. Integration Testing and Security Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Comprehensive integration testing of session management with security validation and performance benchmarking
### Details:
Create integration tests in `/crates/mcp/tests/session_integration_tests.rs` covering full session lifecycle from creation to expiry. Test security measures including Origin validation, DNS rebinding prevention, and session hijacking attempts. Benchmark concurrent session handling performance with 1000+ simultaneous sessions. Validate proper error responses and status codes for all edge cases. Test SSE connection handling with session management. Document security considerations and deployment guidelines in a SECURITY.md file.
