# Task 11: Additional Query Tools Implementation

## Overview
Implement remaining query tools for comprehensive documentation coverage: `cilium_query`, `talos_query`, `meteora_query`, `raydium_query`, `ebpf_query`, `rust_best_practices_query`, and `jupyter_query`.

## Implementation Guide
- Create standardized query tool architecture
- Implement type-specific metadata filtering for each documentation type
- Add specialized response formatting per tool category
- Ensure consistent MCP integration pattern
- Optimize performance across all query tools

## Technical Requirements
- Standardized QueryTool trait implementation
- Type-specific metadata schemas
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Unified response formatting
- Performance parity across all tools

## Success Metrics
- All remaining query tools functional with < 2s response time
- Consistent user experience across tools
- Type-specific optimization for each documentation category
- Complete MCP tool registration
- Comprehensive test coverage for all tools## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
