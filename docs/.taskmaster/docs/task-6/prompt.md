# Autonomous Agent Prompt: Streamable HTTP Response Semantics, Keep-Alive, and Error Handling

## Mission (MVP)
Align response behavior with MCP 2025-06-18 Streamable HTTP for JSON-only POST: ensure headers and JSON-RPC error handling with proper HTTP mapping. Streaming is out of scope for MVP.

## Primary Objectives
1. Ensure `/mcp` POST (JSON) behavior is correct; GET returns 405
2. Include `Mcp-Session-Id` and `MCP-Protocol-Version` in responses
3. Map transport and application errors to correct HTTP status codes
4. Add structured logging

## Implementation Steps
1. Ensure headers are set on all responses (session id, protocol version)
2. Implement JSON-RPC error formatting and HTTP mapping
3. Add logs for request id/session id/version

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Correct headers present on all responses
- [ ] Errors return correct HTTP status and JSON-RPC body
- [ ] Logs capture request/session/version

## Deployment Validation (Mandatory 4-step)
1. Push â†’ CI build/tests
2. Deploy via Helm
3. Live test with MCP client (headers/errors)
4. Record validation results in task artifacts
