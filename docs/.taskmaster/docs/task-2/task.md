# Task 2: Data Migration and Validation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive data migration system with validation to ensure data integrity during production deployment. Since the database starts blank, schedule this task early (after system assessment and DB connectivity) and gate it on those prerequisites.

## Implementation Guide
- Create migration scripts for production data
- Implement data validation and integrity checks
- Add rollback mechanisms for failed migrations
- Create migration monitoring and logging
- Test migration procedures with production-like data

## Dependencies
- Task 1: System assessment complete (architecture and DB readiness)
- Task 6: Database connectivity and baseline schema verified

## Notes from Assessment
- Existing dump is ~184MB; plan for end-to-end load and verify document counts
- Post-load validation must not rely on vector index; verify query paths using metadata filters

## Success Metrics
- Data migration completes successfully
- Data integrity validated post-migration
- Zero data loss during migration process
- Rollback procedures tested and functional
- Migration performance within acceptable limits
