## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Full 184 MB Dataset Migration
**Given**: Empty database and complete 184 MB dataset
**When**: Full migration executed with optimal settings
**Then**:
- All documents processed and stored successfully
- Checksum validation confirms data integrity
- Processing rate ≥1000 docs/minute achieved
- Migration completes within 3 hours
- Final record count matches source expectations

### Test Case 2: Migration Failure and Rollback
**Given**: Migration in progress with simulated failure
**When**: Failure occurs during processing batch
**Then**:
- Failure detected within 30 seconds
- Automatic rollback initiated for failed batch
- Database returned to consistent pre-batch state
- Migration can resume from last successful checkpoint
- No data corruption or orphaned records

### Test Case 3: Incremental Migration and Resumption
**Given**: Partially completed migration with checkpoint
**When**: Migration resumed from checkpoint
**Then**:
- Progress tracking shows accurate completion percentage
- Only remaining documents processed
- No duplicate processing of completed batches
- Final state identical to complete migration
- Checksum validation confirms consistency

### Test Case 4: Parallel Processing Scalability
**Given**: Migration configured with various parallelism levels
**When**: Processing with 1, 4, 8, and 16 parallel workers
**Then**:
- Throughput scales appropriately with worker count
- Resource utilization optimized for each configuration
- No race conditions or data corruption
- Memory usage remains within acceptable bounds
- Performance monitoring shows bottleneck identification

### Test Case 5: Data Validation Accuracy
**Given**: Dataset with intentionally corrupted documents
**When**: Migration with validation enabled
**Then**:
- Corrupted documents detected and reported
- Schema validation catches malformed metadata
- Duplicate detection identifies and handles duplicates
- Vector dimension validation prevents inconsistent data
- Error reporting provides actionable information

### Test Case 6: CLI and Kubernetes Interface Functionality
**Given**: Migration interfaces configured and available
**When**: Migration executed via CLI and Kubernetes Job
**Then**:
- Both interfaces provide equivalent functionality
- Progress reporting works consistently
- Configuration options properly applied
