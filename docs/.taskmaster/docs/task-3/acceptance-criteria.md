- [ ] Well-documented public API with usage examples
- [ ] Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable debugging information

## Test Cases

### TC-1: JSON-RPC Request Processing
**Scenario**: Client sends POST request with valid JSON-RPC message
**Given**: MCP server is running with new transport
**When**: POST request sent to `/mcp` with `Content-Type: application/json`
**And**: Request body contains valid JSON-RPC message
**And**: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18` header present
**Then**: Server processes request through existing MCP handler
**And**: Returns 200 OK status with JSON-RPC response
**And**: Response includes `MCP-Protocol-Version` and `Mcp-Session-Id` headers
**And**: Session is created or retrieved for subsequent requests

### TC-2: Session Management
**Scenario**: Multiple requests with same session ID
**Given**: Client has established session with server
**When**: Multiple requests sent with same `Mcp-Session-Id` header
**Then**: All requests use same session context
**And**: Session activity is updated for each request
**And**: Session remains active until timeout period
**And**: Session cleanup occurs after timeout expires

### TC-3: Concurrent Session Handling
**Scenario**: Multiple clients connect simultaneously
**Given**: MCP server supports concurrent connections
**When**: 100 clients connect with different session IDs
**And**: Each client sends JSON-RPC requests
**Then**: All sessions are managed independently
**And**: No session data corruption occurs
**And**: Performance remains within acceptable limits
**And**: Memory usage scales linearly with session count

### TC-4: Error Handling
**Scenario**: Invalid requests and error conditions
**Given**: MCP server with comprehensive error handling
**When**: Malformed JSON-RPC request is sent
**Or**: Invalid session ID format is provided
**Or**: Unsupported protocol version is used
**Then**: Appropriate error response is returned
**And**: Error follows JSON-RPC error format
**And**: No server crash or instability occurs
**And**: Error details logged for debugging

### TC-5: Integration with Existing Tools
**Scenario**: Existing MCP tools continue to function
**Given**: Doc Server with rust_query and management tools
**When**: Client sends requests for existing tool operations
**Through**: New Streamable HTTP transport
**Then**: All tools respond correctly through new transport
**And**: Tool functionality is unchanged
**And**: Response formats remain consistent
**And**: No tool registration changes required
