# Task 12: Rust Crate Management Tools Enhancement

## Overview

Enhance existing Rust crate management tools (`add_rust_crate`, `remove_rust_crate`, `list_rust_crates`, `check_rust_status`) with improved functionality and integration.

## Implementation Guide

- Enhance add_rust_crate with version management and feature selection
- Improve remove_rust_crate with cleanup verification
- Add comprehensive status reporting to check_rust_status
- Implement atomic operations for crate management
- Add progress tracking and user feedback

## Technical Requirements

- Atomic crate operations with rollback capability
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Comprehensive status reporting
- Integration with batch embedding processing (Task 7)

## Success Metrics

- Atomic crate operations with zero data corruption
- Enhanced user experience with progress feedback
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Integration with new embedding batch processing (Task 7)
- Improved performance for crate management operations## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
