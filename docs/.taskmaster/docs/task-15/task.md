# Task 15: Health Monitoring and Metrics

## Overview
Implement comprehensive health monitoring and metrics collection system for production observability and alerting.

## Implementation Guide
- Add health check endpoints for all components
- Implement Prometheus metrics collection
- Configure Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Set up alerting for critical conditions
- Add performance and resource monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Health checks operational for all services
- Metrics collection and visualization working
- Alerting responds to critical conditions
- Performance monitoring provides insights
- System observability meets operational needs## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
