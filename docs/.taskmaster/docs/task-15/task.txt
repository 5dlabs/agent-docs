# Task ID: 15
# Title: Load Testing and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive load testing to validate performance targets and optimize system bottlenecks.
# Details:
Create load testing suite using scripts/load_test_sse.js as base. Test with 100+ concurrent connections using k6 or vegeta. Identify and optimize query bottlenecks with EXPLAIN ANALYZE. Implement query result caching with TTL. Optimize vector similarity search with approximation techniques. Add connection pooling optimization. Profile CPU and memory usage under load. Implement request coalescing for duplicate queries.

# Test Strategy:
Run sustained load tests (1 hour) with gradual ramp-up, measure p50/p95/p99 latencies, test connection limit handling, verify memory stability under load, and validate cache effectiveness.
