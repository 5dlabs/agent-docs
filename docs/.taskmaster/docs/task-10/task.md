# Task 10: Solana Query Tool Implementation

## Overview
Implement `solana_query` tool for semantic search across Solana blockchain platform documentation including core docs, architecture diagrams, and cryptography specifications.

## Implementation Guide
- Create SolanaQueryTool with comprehensive search capabilities
- Implement metadata filtering for documentation categories
- Add support for multiple content formats (markdown, PDF, diagrams)
- Integrate with existing MCP tool registration
- Optimize for blockchain documentation complexity levels

## Technical Requirements
- Vector similarity search with format-aware processing
- JSONB metadata filtering for categories and complexity
- Multi-format content handling (markdown, PDF, BOB, MSC)
- Tool registration and MCP integration
- Performance optimization for large documentation set

## Success Metrics
- Query response time < 2 seconds
- Multi-format content search capability
- Accurate categorization and filtering
- Complexity-aware result ranking
- Comprehensive Solana ecosystem coverage## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
