- [ ] Proper documentation comments
- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Clippy warnings resolved

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Add Popular Crate (tokio)
**Given**: System is initialized and database is available
**When**: add_rust_crate executed with name "tokio"
**Then**:
- Crate information fetched from docs.rs
- Documentation parsed and stored
- Embeddings generated for all content
- Crate entry created in database
- Operation completes within 30 seconds

### Test Case 2: Remove Crate with Cascade Deletion
**Given**: Crate "serde" exists with documents and embeddings
**When**: remove_rust_crate executed with name "serde"
**Then**:
- All related documents deleted
- All associated embeddings removed
- Crate entry removed from database
- No orphaned data remains
- Transaction committed successfully

### Test Case 3: List Crates with Pagination
**Given**: Database contains 50+ crates
**When**: list_rust_crates executed with page=2, limit=20
**Then**:
- Returns 20 crates from offset 20
- Includes pagination metadata (total_pages, current_page)
- Shows accurate document counts
- Statistics calculated correctly
- Response time under 2 seconds

### Test Case 4: Check System Status
**Given**: System operational with various crates loaded
**When**: check_rust_status executed
**Then**:
- Database connectivity confirmed
- Accurate counts for all entity types
- Storage usage statistics provided
- Health status indicators accurate
- Response time under 5 seconds

### Test Case 5: Rate Limiting Compliance
**Given**: Multiple rapid add_rust_crate requests
**When**: More than 10 requests made within 1 minute
**Then**:
- Rate limiting activates after 10 requests
- Subsequent requests queued appropriately
- No docs.rs API errors from rate limit violations
- System remains stable and responsive

### Test Case 6: Transaction Rollback on Failure
**Given**: Database connection fails during add_rust_crate
**When**: Network error occurs after documentation parsing
**Then**:
- Partial data changes rolled back
- Database remains in consistent state
- Error message provides clear explanation
- System ready for retry operations

## Deliverables Checklist
