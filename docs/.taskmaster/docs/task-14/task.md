# Task 14: Container Registry and CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with container registry integration for automated building, testing, and deployment of the Doc Server.

## Implementation Guide
- Configure GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- Implement container image building with multi-stage Dockerfile
- Set up GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) integration
- Add automated testing pipeline with quality gates
- Configure deployment automation to Kubernetes

## Technical Requirements
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
- Container registry integration (GHCR)
- Automated testing and quality gates
- Kubernetes deployment automation

## Success Metrics
- Automated builds triggered on code changes
- Container images built and published successfully
- Quality gates prevent broken deployments
- Deployment automation works reliably
- Build and deployment times within acceptable limits## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
