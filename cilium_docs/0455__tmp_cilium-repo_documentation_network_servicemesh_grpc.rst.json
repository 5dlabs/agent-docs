Download this for the demo app: \n .. code-block:: shell-session \n $ curl -o demo.proto https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/protos/demo.proto\n \n Deploy GRPC Ingress \n \n You'll find the example Ingress definition in  examples/kubernetes/servicemesh/grpc-ingress.yaml . \n .. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/kubernetes/servicemesh/grpc-ingress.yaml\n:language: yaml \n .. parsed-literal:: \n $ kubectl apply -f \\ |SCM_WEB|\\/examples/kubernetes/servicemesh/grpc-ingress.yaml\n \n This defines paths for requests to be routed to the  productcatalogservice  and\n currencyservice  microservices. \n Just as in the previous HTTP Ingress Example, this creates a LoadBalancer service,\nand it may take a little while for your cloud provider to provision an external\nIP address. \n .. code-block:: shell-session \n $ kubectl get ingress\nNAME           CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE\ngrpc-ingress   cilium   *       10.111.109.99   80      3s\n \n Make gRPC Requests to Backend Services \n \n To issue client gRPC requests you can use  grpcurl <https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#binaries> _. \n .. code-block:: shell-session \n $ GRPC_INGRESS=$(kubectl get ingress grpc-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')\n# To access the currency service:\n$ grpcurl -plaintext -proto ./demo.proto $GRPC_INGRESS:80 hipstershop.CurrencyService/GetSupportedCurrencies\n#To access the product catalog service:\n$ grpcurl -plaintext -proto ./demo.proto $GRPC_INGRESS:80 hipstershop.ProductCatalogService/ListProducts",
