You can create the cluster either in ``podsubnet`` or ``overlay`` mode. \nIn both modes, traffic is routed through the Azure Virtual Network Stack. The choice between these \nmodes depends on the specific use case and requirements of the cluster. Refer to `the related documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-overlay#choosing-a-network-model-to-use>`__  to know more about these two modes.\n\n.. tabs::\n  \n  .. group-tab:: Overlay\n  \n    .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n        az aks create -n <clusterName> -g <resourceGroupName> -l <location> \\\n        --network-plugin azure \\\n        --network-dataplane cilium \\\n        --network-plugin-mode overlay \\\n        --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16\n\n    See also `the detailed instructions from scratch \n    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium#option-1-assign-ip-addresses-from-an-overlay-network>`__.\n\n  .. group-tab:: Podsubnet\n    \n    .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n        az aks create -n <clusterName> -g <resourceGroupName> -l <location> \\\n        --network-plugin azure \\\n        --network-dataplane cilium \\\n        --vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/nodesubnet \\\n        --pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/podsubnet \n\n    See also `the detailed instructions from scratch\n    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium#option-2-assign-ip-addresses-from-a-virtual-network>`_. \n    \n.. include:: k8s-install-validate.rst\n\nDelegated Azure IPAM\n====================\n\nDelegated Azure IPAM (IP Address Manager) manages the IP allocation for pods created in Azure CNI Powered by Cilium clusters.\nIt assigns IPs that are routable in Azure Virtual Network stack.
