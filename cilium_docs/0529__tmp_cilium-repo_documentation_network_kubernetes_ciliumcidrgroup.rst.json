  "content": ".. only:: not (epub or latex or html) \n WARNING: You are looking at unreleased Cilium documentation.\nPlease use the official rendered version released here:\nhttps://docs.cilium.io\n \n .. _CiliumCIDRGroup: \n \n CiliumCIDRGroup \n \n CiliumCIDRGroup (CCG) is a feature that allows administrators to reference a group of\nCIDR blocks in a :ref: CiliumNetworkPolicy . Unlike :ref: CiliumEndpoint  resources,\nwhich are managed by the Cilium agent, CiliumCIDRGroup resources are intended\nto be managed directly by administrators.\nIt is particularly useful for enforcing policies on groups of external CIDR blocks.\nAdditionally, any traffic to CIDRs referenced in the CiliumCIDRGroup will have their\n:ref: Hubble <hubble_intro>  flows annotated with the CCG's name and labels. \n The following is an example of a  CiliumCIDRGroup  object: \n .. code-block:: yaml \n apiVersion: cilium.io/v2alpha1\nkind: CiliumCIDRGroup\nmetadata:\nname: vpn-example-1\nlabels:\nrole: vpn\nspec:\nexternalCIDRs:\n- \"10.48.0.0/24\"\n- \"10.16.0.0/24\" \n The CCG can be referenced in a  CiliumNetworkPolicy \nby using the  fromCIDRSet  directive. CCGs may be selected\nby names or labels. \n .. code-block:: yaml \n apiVersion: cilium.io/v2\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\nname: from-vpn-example\nspec:\nendpointSelector: {}\ningress:\n## select by name\n- fromCIDRSet:\n- cidrGroupRef: vpn-example-1\n## alternatively, select by label:\n- fromCIDRSet:\n- cidrGroupSelector:\nmatchLabels:\nrole: vpn \n In this example, the  fromCIDRSet  directive in the CNP references the\n vpn-example-1  group defined in the  CiliumCIDRGroup . This allows the CNP to\napply ingress rules based on the CIDRs grouped under the  vpn-example-1  name.",
