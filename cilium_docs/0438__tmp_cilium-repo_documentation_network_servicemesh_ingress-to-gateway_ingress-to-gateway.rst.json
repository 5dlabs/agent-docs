To address these technical limitations, \nsoftware vendors and developers created vendor-specific annotations. However, using annotations \ncreated inconsistencies from one Ingress Controller to another. For example, issues often arise when switching from one Ingress Controller to another because annotations are often vendor-specific.\n\n- Operational constraints\n  \nFinally, the Ingress API suffers from operational constraints: it is not well suited for multi-team clusters with shared load-balancing infrastructure.\n\nBenefits of the Gateway API\n###########################\n\nThe Gateway API was designed to address the limitations of Ingress API. The `Kubernetes SIG-Network <https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network>`_ team designs and maintains the Gateway API.\n\nFor more information about the Gateway API, see `the Gateway API project page <https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/>`_.\n\nThe Gateway API provides a centralized mechanism for managing and enforcing policies for external traffic, \nincluding HTTP routing, TLS termination, traffic splitting/weighting, and header modification.\n\nNative support of policies for external traffic means that annotations are no longer required to support ingress traffic patterns. This means that Gateway API resources are more portable from one Gateway API implementation to another.\n\nWhen customization is required, Gateway API provides several flexible models, including specific extension points to enable diverse \ntraffic patterns. As the Gateway API team adds extensions, the team looks for common denominators and promotes features of API conformance to maximize the ease of extending Ingress API resources.\n\nFinally, the Gateway API is designed with role-based personas in mind. The Ingress model is based on a persona where \ndevelopers manage and create ingress and service resources themselves.\n\nIn more complex deployments, more personas are involved:\n\n- Infrastructure Providers administrate the managed services of a cloud provider, or the infrastructure/network team when running Kubernetes on-premises.\n- Cluster Operators are responsible for the administration of a cluster.\n- Application Developers are responsible for defining application configuration and service composition.\n\nBy deconstructing the Ingress API into several Gateway API objects, personas gain the specific access and privileges that their responsibilities require.\n\nFor example, application developers in a specific team could be assigned permissions to create Route objects in a specified namespace \nwithout also gaining permissions to modify the Gateway configuration or edit Route objects in namespaces other than theirs.\n\nMigration Methods\n#################\n\nThere are two primary methods to migrate Ingress API resources to Gateway API:\n\n- *manual*: manually creating Gateway API resources based on existing Ingress API resources.\n- *automated*: creating rules using the `ingress2gateway tool <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway>`_. \n  The ingress2gateway project reads Ingress resources from a Kubernetes cluster based on your current Kube Config. It outputs YAML for equivalent Gateway API resources to stdout.\n\n.. note::\n  \n    The ``ingress2gateway`` tool remains experimental and is not recommended for production.\n\nIngress Annotations Migration\n#############################\n\nMost Ingress controllers use annotations to provide support for specific features, such as HTTP request manipulation and routing. \nAs noted in `Benefits of the Gateway API`_, the Gateway API avoids implementation-specific annotations in order to provide a portable configuration.\n\nAs a consequence, it's rare to port implementation-specific Ingress annotations to a Gateway API resource. \nInstead, the Gateway API provides native support for some of these features, including:\n\n- Request/response manipulation\n- Traffic splitting\n- Header, query parameter, or method-based routing\n\nExamples\n########\n\nFor examples of migrating to Cilium's Gateway API features, see:\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 1\n   :glob:\n\n   http-migration\n   tls-migration\n\n",
