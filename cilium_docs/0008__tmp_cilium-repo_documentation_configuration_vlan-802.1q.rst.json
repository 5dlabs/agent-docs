VLAN 802.1q packets\nwill always be passed through their main device with associated tag (e.g. VLAN device is ``eth0.4000`` and its main interface is ``eth0``).\nBy default, Cilium will allow all tags from the native devices (i.e. if ``eth0.4000`` is controlled by Cilium and has\nan eBPF program attached, then VLAN tag ``4000`` will be allowed on device ``eth0``). Additional VLAN tags may be allowed\nwith the cilium-agent flag ``--vlan-bpf-bypass=4001,4002`` (or Helm variable ``--set bpf.vlanBypass=\"[4001,4002]\"``).\n\nThe list of allowed VLAN tags cannot be too big in order to keep eBPF program of predictable size. Currently this list\nshould contain no more than 5 entries. If you need more, then there is only one way for now: you need to allow\nall tags with cilium-agent flag ``--vlan-bpf-bypass=0``.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Currently, the cilium-agent will scan for available VLAN devices and tags only on startup.\n",
