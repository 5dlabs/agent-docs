This guide describes\nhow to contribute a PR which modifies the Renovate configuration. There are two\ncomplementary methods for validating Renovate changes: Linting with the \"local\"\nplatform, and testing the updates in your own fork.\n\nLinting locally\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUse the ``renovate/renovate`` docker image to perform a dry run of Renovate.\nThis step should complete in less than ten minutes, and it will report syntax\nerrors in the configuration.\n\n#. Make some changes to the Renovate configuration in ``.github/renovate.json5``.\n#. Run the renovate image against the new configuration.\n\n.. tabs::\n\n   .. group-tab:: Simple\n\n      .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n         make renovate-local\n\n   .. group-tab:: Advanced\n\n      .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n         docker run -ti -e LOG_LEVEL=debug \\\n                    -e GITHUB_COM_TOKEN=\"$(gh auth token)\" \\\n                    -v /tmp:/tmp \\\n                    -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app \\\n                    docker.io/renovate/renovate:slim \\\n                    renovate --platform=local \\\n         | tee renovate.log\n\nThis approach is based on the `Local platform guide <https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/platform/local/>`__\nprovided by Renovate. See that guide for more details about usage and\nlimitations.\n\nTesting on a fork\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFor most changes to the Renovate configuration, you will likely need to test\nthe changes on your own fork of Cilium.\n\n#. Make some changes to the Renovate configuration. Renovate is configured in\n   ``.github/renovate.json5``.\n#. (Optional) Disable unrelated configuration. For an example, see\n   `this commit <https://github.com/joestringer/cilium/commit/4a80859a882c92973dd5b25f5c31de614abcf5de>`__.\n#. Push the branch to the default branch of your own fork.\n#. `Enable the Renovate GitHub app <https://github.com/apps/renovate>`__ in\n   your GitHub account.\n#. Ensure that Renovate is enabled in the repository settings in the\n   `Renovate Dashboard <https://app.renovatebot.com/dashboard>`__.\n#. Trigger the Renovate app from the dashboard or push a fresh commit to your\n   fork's default branch to trigger Renovate again.\n#. Use the dashboard to trigger Renovate to create a PR on your fork and\n   validate that the proposed PRs are updating the correct parts of the codebase.\n\nOnce you have tested that the Renovate configuration works in your own fork,\ncreate a PR against Cilium and provide links in the description to inform\nreviewers about the testing you have performed on the changes.\n",
