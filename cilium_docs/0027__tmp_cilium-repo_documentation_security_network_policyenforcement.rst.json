This means that the intent of the policy is to\ndescribe allowed direction of connection establishment. If the policy allows\n``A => B`` then reply packets from ``B`` to ``A`` are automatically allowed as\nwell.  However, ``B`` is not automatically allowed to initiate connections to\n``A``. If that outcome is desired, then both directions must be explicitly\nallowed.\n\nSecurity policies may be enforced at *ingress* or *egress*. For *ingress*,\nthis means that each cluster node verifies all incoming packets and determines\nwhether the packet is allowed to be transmitted to the intended endpoint.\nCorrespondingly, for *egress* each cluster node verifies outgoing packets and\ndetermines whether the packet is allowed to be transmitted to its intended\ndestination.\n\nIn order to enforce identity based security in a multi host cluster, the\nidentity of the transmitting endpoint is embedded into every network packet\nthat is transmitted in between cluster nodes. The receiving cluster node can\nthen extract the identity and verify whether a particular identity is allowed\nto communicate with any of the local endpoints.\n\nDefault Security Policy\n=======================\n\nIf no policy is loaded, the default behavior is to allow all communication\nunless policy enforcement has been explicitly enabled. As soon as the first\npolicy rule is loaded, policy enforcement is enabled automatically and any\ncommunication must then be white listed or the relevant packets will be\ndropped.\n\nSimilarly, if an endpoint is not subject to an *L4* policy, communication from\nand to all ports is permitted. Associating at least one *L4* policy to an\nendpoint will block all connectivity to ports unless explicitly allowed.\n",
