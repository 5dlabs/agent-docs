When an API client makes a\nrequest to an API endpoint that is administratively disabled, the server\nresponds with an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.\n\nYou can configure the option with a list of endpoints as described in the\nfollowing sections, or by specifying an option with the ``*`` suffix. If ``*``\nis provided directly as a flag value, then all APIs are enabled. If there is\ntext before the ``*``, then the API flag must start with that prefix in order\nfor the flag to enable that option. For example, ``Get*`` enables all read-only\n\"GET\" APIs without enabling any write APIs.\n\nThe cilium-agent relies on several of these APIs for its basic duties. In\nparticular, disabling the following APIs will likely cause significant\ndisruption to agent operations:\n\n- ``GetConfig``\n- ``GetHealthz``\n- ``PutEndpointID``\n- ``DeleteEndpointID``\n- ``PostIPAM``\n- ``DeleteIPAMIP``\n\nThe following sections outline the flags for different Cilium binaries and the\nAPI endpoints that may be configured using those flags.\n\n.. include:: api-restrictions-table.rst\n",
