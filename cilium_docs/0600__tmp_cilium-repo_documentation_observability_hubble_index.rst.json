Hubble is able to provide visibility at the\nnode level, cluster level or even across clusters in a :ref:`Cluster Mesh`\nscenario. For an introduction to Hubble and how it relates to Cilium, read the\nsection :ref:`intro`.\n\nBy default, Hubble API operates within the scope of the individual node on which the\nCilium agent runs. This confines the network insights to the traffic observed by the local\nCilium agent. Hubble CLI (``hubble``) can be used to query the Hubble API provided via a local\nUnix Domain Socket. The Hubble CLI binary is installed by default on Cilium agent pods.\n\nUpon deploying Hubble Relay, network visibility is provided for the entire cluster or even\nmultiple clusters in a ClusterMesh scenario. In this mode, Hubble data can be accessed by\ndirecting Hubble CLI (``hubble``) to the Hubble Relay service or via Hubble UI.\nHubble UI is a web interface which enables automatic discovery of the services dependency\ngraph at the L3/L4 and even L7 layer, allowing user-friendly visualization and filtering\nof data flows as a service map.\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 2\n   :glob:\n\n   setup\n   hubble-cli\n   hubble-ui\n   configuration/export\n   configuration/tls\n",
