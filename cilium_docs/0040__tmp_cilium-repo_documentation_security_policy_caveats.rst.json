If not, i.e., the request needs to be forwarded to\nanother node after the service endpoint selection, then it will have the ``reserved:remote-node``.\n\nThe latter traffic will match ``fromEntities: cluster`` policies.\n\nDifferences From Kubernetes Network Policies\n============================================\n\nWhen creating Cilium Network Policies it is important to keep in mind that Cilium Network\nPolicies do not perfectly replicate the functionality of `Kubernetes Network Policies <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/>`_.\nSee :ref:`this table <networkpolicy_state>` for differences.\n",
