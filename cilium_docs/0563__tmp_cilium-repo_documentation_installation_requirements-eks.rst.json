However,\nthere are other options. Please make sure to read and understand the\ndocumentation page on :ref: taint effects and unmanaged pods<taint_effects> . \n Below is an example on how to use  ClusterConfig <https://eksctl.io/usage/creating-and-managing-clusters/#using-config-files> _\nfile to create the cluster: \n .. code-block:: yaml \n apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5\nkind: ClusterConfig\n...\nmanagedNodeGroups:\n- name: ng-1\n  ...\n  # taint nodes so that application pods are\n  # not scheduled/executed until Cilium is deployed.\n  # Alternatively, see the note above regarding taint effects.\n  taints:\n   - key: \"node.cilium.io/agent-not-ready\"\n     value: \"true\"\n     effect: \"NoExecute\"\n \n \n \n \n \n Limitations: \n \n The AWS ENI integration of Cilium is currently only enabled for IPv4. If you\nwant to use IPv6, use a datapath/IPAM mode other than ENI.",
