Specifically, the following is supported:\n - Pod <-> Pod communication\n - Pod <-> Service communication [*]\n - Pod <-> Pod communication with network policies applied to SCTP traffic [*]\n\n.. note::\n   [*] SCTP support does not support rewriting ports for SCTP packets. This means\n   that when defining services, the targetPort **MUST** equal the port, otherwise\n   the packet will be dropped.\n\n.. warning::\n   Cilium does not support the following for SCTP:\n    - Multihoming\n    - Policies for pod-to-VIP\n    - :ref:`Kube-proxy replacement (KPR)<kubeproxy-free>` when port rewriting\n      is necessary: for example, NodePort Services are not supported with the\n      combination of KPR and SCTP.    \n    - BPF masquerading\n    - Egress gateway\n",
