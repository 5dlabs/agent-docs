To learn\n    more about keyless signing, please refer to `Keyless Signatures`_.\n    \n    ``--certificate-github-workflow-name string`` contains the workflow claim \n    from the GitHub OIDC Identity token that contains the name of the executed \n    workflow. For the names of workflows used to build Cilium images, see the \n    ``build-images`` workflows under `Cilium workflows`_.\n    \n    ``--certificate-github-workflow-ref string`` contains the ref claim from \n    the GitHub OIDC Identity token that contains the git ref that the workflow \n    run was based upon.\n\n    ``--certificate-identity`` is used to verify the identity of the certificate\n    from the GitHub build images release workflow.\n    \n\n.. _`Keyless Signatures`: https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/#the-signing-witnessing-and-verifying-process\n.. _`Cilium workflows`: https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/main/.github/workflows\n",
