You can bump the dependency by first\nrunning:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n        go get github.com/cilium/cilium@main\n\nHowever, Cilium's ``go.mod`` contains ``replace`` directives, which are ignored\nby ``go get`` and ``go mod``. Therefore you must also manually copy any updated\n``replace`` directives from Cilium's ``go.mod`` to Hubble's ``go.mod``.\n\nOnce you have done this you can tidy up, vendor the modules, and verify them:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n        go mod tidy\n        go mod vendor\n        go mod verify\n\nThe bumped dependency should be committed as a single commit containing all the\nchanges to ``go.mod``, ``go.sum``, and the ``vendor`` directory.\n",
