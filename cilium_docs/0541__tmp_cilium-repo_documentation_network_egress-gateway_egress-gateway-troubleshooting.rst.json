These connections will have the same source IP and destination IP & port. In Cilium's datapath, each connection to this destination will be mapped using a unique source port. \n If too many connections are made through the egress-gateway node, Cilium's SNAT map can reach capacity, which will result in old connections not being tracked, causing connectivity issues. \n The limit is equal to the difference between max NAT node port value (65535) and the upper bound of  --node-port-range  (default: 32767). By default, an egress-gateway Node can handle 65535 - 32767 = 32768 possible connections to a common remote endpoint address, using the same egress IP. \n High SNAT port mapping utilization can also result in egress-gateway connection failures as Cilium's SNAT mapping fails to find available source ports for masquerade SNAT. \n Cilium agent stores stats about the top 30 such connection tuples, this can be accessed inside a cilium agent container using the  cilium-dbg  utility. \n .. code-block:: shell-session \n $ kubectl -n kube-system exec ds/cilium -- cilium-dbg shell -- db/show nat-stats\n# IPFamily   Proto    EgressIP                RemoteAddr                   Count\nipv4         TCP      10.244.1.160            10.244.3.174:4240            1\nipv4         ICMP     172.18.0.2              172.18.0.3                   1\nipv4         TCP      172.18.0.2              172.18.0.3:4240              1\nipv4         TCP      172.18.0.2              172.18.0.4:6443              50\nipv4         TCP      172.18.0.2              104.198.14.52:443            294\nipv6         ICMPv6   [fc00:c111::2]          [fc00:c111::3]               1\nipv6         TCP      [fd00:10:244:1::ec5d]   [fd00:10:244:3::730c]:4240   1\nipv6         TCP      [fd00:10:244:1::ec5d]   [fd00:10:244::915]:4240      1\n \n Note : These stats are re-calculated every 30 seconds by default. So there is a delay between new connections occurring and when the stats are updated. \n If you observe one or more row having a very large connection count (i.e. approaching the default connection limit: 32768), then this may indicate SNAT connection overflow issues. \n Because this problem is a result of hitting a hard limit on Cilium's Egress Gateway functionality, the only solution is to reduce the number of connections\nthat are being SNATed through an egress-gateway, This can be done by having clients avoid creating as many new connections, or by lowering the amount of connections going to the same remote address (with a common egress IP) by splitting up traffic via different egress IPs and/or remote endpoint addresses. \n For alerting and observability on SNAT source port utilization please see the :ref: NAT endpoint max connection <nat_metrics>  metric which tracks the top saturation (as a percentage of total the max available) of a Cilium Agent.",
