  "content": ".. only:: not (epub or latex or html)\n\n    WARNING: You are looking at unreleased Cilium documentation.\n    Please use the official rendered version released here:\n    https://docs.cilium.io\n\n.. _docs_structure_recommendations:\n\n******************************************\nRecommendations on documentation structure\n******************************************\n\nThis page contains recommendations to help contributors write better\ndocumentation. The goal of better documentation is a better user experience. If\nyou take only one thing away from this guide, let it be this: don't document\nyour feature. Instead, **document how your feature guides users on their\njourney.**\n\nMaintaining good information architecture\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhen you add, update, or remove documentation, consider how the change affects\nthe site's `information architecture`_. Information architecture is what shapes\na user's experience and their ability to accomplish their goals with Cilium. If\nan addition, change, or removal would significantly alter a user's journey or\nprevent their success, make sure to flag the change clearly in :ref:`upgrade\nnotes <current_release_required_changes>`.\n\n.. _information architecture: https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/information-architecture.html\n\nAdding a new page\n-----------------\n\nWhen you need to write completely new content, create one or more new pages as\none of the three following types:\n\n- Concept (no steps, just knowledge)\n- Task (how to do one discrete thing)\n- Tutorial (how to combine multiple features to accomplish specific goals)\n\nA *concept* explains some aspect of Cilium. Typically, concept pages don't\ninclude sequences of steps. Instead, they link to tasks or tutorials.\n\nFor an example of a concept page, see :ref:`Routing <Routing>`.\n\nA *task* shows how to do one discrete thing with Cilium. Task pages give\nreaders a sequence of steps to perform. A task page can be short or long, but\nmust remain focused on the task's singular goal. Task pages can blend brief\nexplanations with the steps to perform, but if you need to provide a lengthy\nexplanation, write a separate concept and link to it. Link related task and\nconcept pages to each other.\n\nFor an example of a task page, see :ref:`Migrating a Cluster to Cilium\n<cni_migration>`.\n\nA *tutorial* shows how to accomplish a goal using multiple Cilium features.\nTutorials are flexible: for example, a tutorial page could provide several\ndiscrete sequences of steps to perform, or show how related pieces of code\ncould interact. Tutorials can blend brief explanations with the steps to\nperform, but lengthy explanations should link to related concept topics.\n\nFor an example of a tutorial page, see :ref:`Inspecting Network Flows with the\nCLI <hubble_cli>`.\n\n.. note::\n\n  You may need to add multiple pages to support a new feature. For example, if\n  a new feature requires an explanation of its underlying ideas, add a concept\n  page as well as a task page.\n\nUpdating an existing page\n-------------------------\n\nConsider whether you can update an existing page or whether to add a new one.\n\nIf adding or updating content to a page keeps it centered on a single concept\nor task, then you can update an existing page. If adding or updating content to\na page expands it to include multiple concepts or tasks, then add new pages for\nindividual concepts and tasks.\n\nIf you're moving a page and changing its URL, make sure you update every link\nto that page in the documentation. Ask on `Cilium Slack`_ (``#sig-docs``) for\nsomeone to set up a HTTP redirection from the old URL to the new one, if\nnecessary.\n\nRemoving content and entire pages\n---------------------------------\n\nRemoving stale content is a part of maintaining healthy docs.\n\nWhether you're removing stale content on a page or removing a page altogether,\nmake sure to consider the impact of removal on a user's journey. Specific\nconsiderations include:\n\n- Updating any links to removed content\n- Ensuring users have clear guidance on what to do next\n\n.. note::\n\n  Without a clearly defined user journey, evaluation is largely qualitative.\n  Practice empathy: would someone succeed if they had your skills but not your\n  context?\n",
