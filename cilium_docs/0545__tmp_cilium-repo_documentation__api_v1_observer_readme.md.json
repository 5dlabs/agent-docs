Incompatible with  since/until . Defaults to the most recent (last)  number  events, unless  first  is true, then it will return the earliest  number  events. \n first bool first specifies if we should look at the first  number  events or the last  number  of events. Incompatible with  follow . \n follow bool follow sets when the server should continue to stream agent events after printing the last N agent events. \n since google.protobuf.Timestamp Since this time for returned agent events.

Incompatible with  since/until . Defaults to the most recent (last)  number  events, unless  first  is true, then it will return the earliest  number  events. \n first bool first specifies if we should look at the first  number  events or the last  number  of events. Incompatible with  follow . \n follow bool follow sets when the server should continue to stream debug events after printing the last N debug events. \n since google.protobuf.Timestamp Since this time for returned debug events. Incompatible with  number . \n until google.protobuf.Timestamp Until this time for returned debug events. Incompatible with  number . \n \n \n GetDebugEventsResponse \n GetDebugEventsResponse contains a Cilium datapath debug events. \n Field Type Label Description \n debug_event flow.DebugEvent \n node_name string Name of the node where this event was observed. \n time google.protobuf.Timestamp Timestamp at which this event was observed. \n \n \n GetFlowsRequest \n Field Type Label Description \n number uint64 Number of flows that should be returned. Incompatible with  since/until . Defaults to the most recent (last)  number  flows, unless  first  is true, then it will return the earliest  number  flows. \n first bool first specifies if we should look at the first  number  flows or the last  number  of flows. Incompatible with  follow . \n follow bool follow sets when the server should continue to stream flows after printing the last N flows. \n blacklist flow.FlowFilter repeated blacklist defines a list of filters which have to match for a flow to be excluded from the result. If multiple blacklist filters are specified, only one of them has to match for a flow to be excluded. \n whitelist flow.FlowFilter repeated whitelist defines a list of filters which have to match for a flow to be included in the result. If multiple whitelist filters are specified, only one of them has to match for a flow to be included. The whitelist and blacklist can both be specified. In such cases, the set of the returned flows is the set difference  whitelist - blacklist . In other words, the result will contain all flows matched by the whitelist that are not also simultaneously matched by the blacklist. \n since google.protobuf.Timestamp Since this time for returned flows. Incompatible with  number . \n until google.protobuf.Timestamp Until this time for returned flows. Incompatible with  number . \n field_mask google.protobuf.FieldMask FieldMask allows clients to limit flow's fields that will be returned. For example, {paths: [\"source.id\", \"destination.id\"]} will return flows with only these two fields set. \n experimental GetFlowsRequest.Experimental \n extensions google.protobuf.Any extensions can be used to add arbitrary additional metadata to GetFlowsRequest. This can be used to extend functionality for other Hubble compatible APIs, or experiment with new functionality without needing to change the public API. \n \n \n GetFlowsRequest.Experimental \n Experimental contains fields that are not stable yet. Support for\nexperimental features is always optional and subject to change. \n \n GetFlowsResponse \n GetFlowsResponse contains either a flow or a protocol message. \n Field Type Label Description \n flow flow.Flow \n node_status relay.NodeStatusEvent node_status informs clients about the state of the nodes participating in this particular GetFlows request. \n lost_events flow.LostEvent lost_events informs clients about events which got dropped due to a Hubble component being unavailable \n node_name string Name of the node where this event was observed. \n time google.protobuf.Timestamp Timestamp at which this event was observed. \n \n \n GetNamespacesRequest \n \n GetNamespacesResponse \n GetNamespacesResponse contains the list of namespaces. \n Field Type Label Description \n namespaces Namespace repeated Namespaces is a list of namespaces with flows \n \n \n GetNodesRequest \n \n GetNodesResponse \n GetNodesResponse contains the list of nodes. \n Field Type Label Description \n nodes Node repeated Nodes is an exhaustive list of nodes. \n \n \n Namespace \n Field Type Label Description \n cluster string \n namespace string \n \n \n Node \n Node represents a cluster node. \n Field Type Label Description \n name string Name is the name of the node. \n version string Version is the version of Cilium/Hubble as reported by the node. \n address string Address is the network address of the API endpoint. \n state relay.NodeState State represents the known state of the node. \n tls TLS TLS reports TLS related information. \n uptime_ns uint64 UptimeNS is the uptime of this instance in nanoseconds \n num_flows uint64 number of currently captured flows \n max_flows uint64 maximum capacity of the ring buffer \n seen_flows uint64 total amount of flows observed since the observer was started \n \n \n ServerStatusRequest \n \n ServerStatusResponse \n Field Type Label Description \n num_flows uint64 number of currently captured flows In a multi-node context, this is the cumulative count of all captured flows. \n max_flows uint64 maximum capacity of the ring buffer In a multi-node context, this is the aggregation of all ring buffers capacities. \n seen_flows uint64 total amount of flows observed since the observer was started In a multi-node context, this is the aggregation of all flows that have been seen. \n uptime_ns uint64 uptime of this observer instance in nanoseconds In a multi-node context, this field corresponds to the uptime of the longest living instance. \n num_connected_nodes google.protobuf.UInt32Value number of nodes for which a connection is established \n num_unavailable_nodes google.protobuf.UInt32Value number of nodes for which a connection cannot be established \n unavailable_nodes string repeated list of nodes that are unavailable This list may not be exhaustive. \n version string Version is the version of Cilium/Hubble. \n flows_rate double Approximate rate of flows seen by Hubble per second over the last minute.
