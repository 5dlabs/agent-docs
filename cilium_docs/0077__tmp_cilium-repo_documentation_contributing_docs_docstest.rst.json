  "content": ".. only:: not (epub or latex or html)\n  \n    WARNING: You are looking at unreleased Cilium documentation.\n    Please use the official rendered version released here:\n    https://docs.cilium.io\n\n.. _testing-documentation:\n\nDocumentation testing\n=====================\n\nFirst, start a local document server that automatically refreshes when you save files for\nreal-time preview. It relies on the ``cilium/docs-builder`` Docker container.\n\nSet up your development environment\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo run Cilium's documentation locally, you need to install `docker engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_ and also the ``make`` package.\nTo verify that ``make`` and ``docker`` is installed, run the command ``make --version`` and ``docker --version`` in your terminal.\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ docker --version\n    Docker version 20.10.22, build 3a2c30b\n    $ make --version\n    GNU Make 4.2.1\n\nFor Windows\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. Note::\n\n    The preferred method is to upgrade to Windows 10 version 1903 Build 18362 or higher, you can upgrade to Windows Subsystem for Linux ``WSL2`` and run ``make`` in Linux.\n\n#. Verify you have access to the ``make`` command in your ``WSL2`` terminal.\n#. Download and install docker desktop.\n#. Set up docker to use `WSL2 <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/>`_ as backend.\n#. Start docker desktop.\n\nPreview documentation locally\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNavigate to the root of the folder where you cloned the project, then run the code below in your terminal:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ make render-docs\n\nThis will build a docker image and start a docker container. Preview the documentation at http://localhost:9081/ as you make changes. After making changes to\nCilium documentation you should check that you did not introduce any new warnings or errors, and also\ncheck that your changes look as you intended one last time before opening a pull request. To do this\nyou can build the docs:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ make test-docs\n\n.. note::\n\n   By default, ``render-docs`` generates a preview with instructions to install\n   Cilium from the latest version on GitHub (i.e. from the HEAD of the main branch that has\n   not been released) regardless of which Cilium branch you are in. You can target a specific\n   branch by specifying ``READTHEDOCS_VERSION`` environment variable:\n\n   .. code-block:: shell-session\n\n      READTHEDOCS_VERSION=v1.7 make render-docs\n\nSubmit local changes on GitHub (Pull Request)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSee the :ref:`submit a pull request <submit_pr>` section of the contributing guide.\n",
