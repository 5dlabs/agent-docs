Changing the IPAM mode in\na live environment may cause persistent disruption of connectivity for existing workloads.\nThe safest path to change IPAM mode is to install a fresh Kubernetes cluster with the new IPAM configuration.\nIf you are interested in extending Cilium to support migration between IPAM modes, see :gh-issue:`27164`.\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 1\n   :glob:\n\n   cluster-pool\n   kubernetes\n   multi-pool\n   azure\n   azure-delegated-ipam\n   eni\n   gke\n   crd\n   deep_dive\n",
