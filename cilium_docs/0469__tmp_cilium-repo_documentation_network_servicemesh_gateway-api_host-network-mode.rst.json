  "content": ".. only:: not (epub or latex or html) \n WARNING: You are looking at unreleased Cilium documentation.\nPlease use the official rendered version released here:\nhttps://docs.cilium.io\n \n Host network mode \n \n .. note::\nSupported since Cilium 1.16+ \n Host network mode allows you to expose the Cilium Gateway API Gateway directly\non the host network.\nThis is useful in cases where a LoadBalancer Service is unavailable, such\nas in development environments or environments with cluster-external\nloadbalancers. \n .. note::\n* Enabling the Cilium Gateway API host network mode automatically disables the LoadBalancer type Service mode. They are mutually exclusive.\n* The listener is exposed on all interfaces ( 0.0.0.0  for IPv4 and/or  ::  for IPv6). \n Host network mode can be enabled via Helm: \n .. code-block:: yaml \n gatewayAPI:\n  enabled: true\n  hostNetwork:\n    enabled: true\n \n Once enabled, the host network port for a  Gateway  can be specified via\n spec.listeners.port . The port must be unique per  Gateway \nresource and you should choose a port number higher than  1023  (see\n Bind to privileged port _). \n .. warning::\nBe aware that misconfiguration might result in port clashes. Configure unique ports that are still available on all Cilium Nodes where Gateway API listeners are exposed. \n Bind to privileged port \n By default, the Cilium L7 Envoy process does not have any Linux capabilities\nout-of-the-box and is therefore not allowed to listen on privileged ports. \n If you choose a port equal to or lower than  1023 , ensure that the Helm value\n envoy.securityContext.capabilities.keepCapNetBindService=true  is configured\nand to add the capability  NET_BIND_SERVICE  to the respective\n:ref: Cilium Envoy container via Helm values<envoy> : \n \n Standalone DaemonSet mode:  envoy.securityContext.capabilities.envoy \n Embedded mode:  securityContext.capabilities.ciliumAgent \n \n Configure the following Helm values to allow privileged port bindings in host\nnetwork mode: \n .. tabs:: \n .. group-tab:: Standalone DaemonSet mode\n\n  .. code-block:: yaml\n\n      gatewayAPI:\n        enabled: true\n        hostNetwork:\n          enabled: true\n      envoy:\n        enabled: true\n        securityContext:\n          capabilities:\n            keepCapNetBindService: true\n            envoy:\n            # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)\n            - NET_BIND_SERVICE\n\n.. group-tab:: Embedded mode\n\n  .. code-block:: yaml\n\n      gatewayAPI:\n        enabled: true\n        hostNetwork:\n          enabled: true\n      envoy:\n        securityContext:\n          capabilities:\n            keepCapNetBindService: true\n      securityContext:\n        capabilities:\n          ciliumAgent:\n          # Add NET_BIND_SERVICE to the list (keep the others!)\n          - NET_BIND_SERVICE\n \n Deploy Gateway API listeners on subset of nodes \n The Cilium Gateway API Envoy listener can be exposed on a specific subset of\nnodes. This only works in combination with the host network mode and can be\nconfigured via a node label selector in the Helm values: \n .. code-block:: yaml \n gatewayAPI:\n  enabled: true\n  hostNetwork:\n    enabled: true\n    nodes:\n      matchLabels:\n        role: infra\n        component: gateway-api\n \n This will deploy the Gateway API Envoy listener only on the Cilium Nodes\nmatching the configured labels. An empty selector selects all nodes and\ncontinues to expose the functionality on all Cilium nodes.",
