Security policies can be specified and imported via the following\nmechanisms:\n\n* Using Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`, `CiliumNetworkPolicy` and `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`\n  resources. See the section :ref:`k8s_policy` for more details. In this mode,\n  Kubernetes will automatically distribute the policies to all agents.\n\n* Directly imported into the agent via CLI or :ref:`api_ref` of the agent. This\n  method does not automatically distribute policies to all agents. It is in the\n  responsibility of the user to import the policy in all required agents. (This\n  method is deprecated as of v1.18 and will be removed in v1.19.)\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 2\n   :glob:\n\n   intro\n   language\n   kubernetes\n   lifecycle\n   troubleshooting\n   caveats\n",
