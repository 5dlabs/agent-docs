This is useful when upgrading cilium with\nDNS Polling policies where an interruption in allowed IPs is undesirable. It\nmay also be used when switching from DNS Polling based DNS discovery to DNS\nProxy based discovery where an endpoint may not make a DNS request soon\nenough to be used by toFQDNs policy rules \n cilium-dbg preflight fqdn-poller [flags]\n \n Options \n   -h, --help                        help for fqdn-poller\n      --tofqdns-pre-cache string    The path to write serialized ToFQDNs pre-cache information. stdout is the default\n      --tofqdns-pre-cache-ttl int   TTL, in seconds, to set on generated ToFQDNs pre-cache information (default 604800)\n \n Options inherited from parent commands \n       --config string        Config file (default is $HOME/.cilium.yaml)\n  -D, --debug                Enable debug messages\n  -H, --host string          URI to server-side API\n      --log-driver strings   Logging endpoints to use (example: syslog)\n      --log-opt map          Log driver options (example: format=json)\n \n SEE ALSO \n \n cilium-dbg preflight \t - Cilium upgrade helper",
