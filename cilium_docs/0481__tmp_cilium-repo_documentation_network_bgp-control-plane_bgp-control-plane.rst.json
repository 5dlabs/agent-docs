BGP Control Plane makes Pod networks and/or Services reachable\nfrom outside the cluster for environments that support BGP. Because BGP\nControl Plane does not program the :ref:`datapath <ebpf_datapath>`, do not use it to establish\nreachability within the cluster.\n\n.. admonition:: Video\n  :class: attention\n\n  For more insights on Cilium's BGP, check out `eCHO episode 101: More BGP fun with Cilium <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv0R6VxyWhc>`__.\n\n.. _Border Gateway Protocol: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4271\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. tabs::\n\n  .. group-tab:: Helm\n\n        Cilium BGP Control Plane can be enabled with Helm flag ``bgpControlPlane.enabled``\n        set as true.\n\n        .. parsed-literal::\n\n            $ helm upgrade cilium |CHART_RELEASE| \\\\\n                --namespace kube-system \\\\\n                --reuse-values \\\\\n                --set bgpControlPlane.enabled=true\n            $ kubectl -n kube-system rollout restart ds/cilium\n\n  .. group-tab:: Cilium CLI\n\n        .. include:: ../../installation/cli-download.rst\n\n        Cilium BGP Control Plane can be enabled with the following command\n\n        .. parsed-literal::\n\n            $ cilium install |CHART_VERSION| --set bgpControlPlane.enabled=true\n\nIPv4/IPv6 single-stack and dual-stack setup are supported. Note that the BGP\nControl Plane can only advertise the route of the address family that the\nCilium is configured to use. You cannot advertise IPv4 routes when the Cilium\nAgent is configured to use only IPv6 address family. Conversely, you cannot advertise\nIPv6 routes when Cilium Agent is configured to use only IPv4 address family.\n\nConfiguring BGP Control Plane\n-----------------------------\n\nThere are two ways to configure the BGP Control Plane. Using legacy ``CiliumBGPPeeringPolicy`` resource,\nor using newer BGP resources like ``CiliumBGPClusterConfig``. Currently, both configuration options are\nsupported, however ``CiliumBGPPeeringPolicy`` will be deprecated in the future.\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :glob:\n\n    bgp-control-plane-v2\n    bgp-control-plane-v1\n\nTroubleshooting and Operation Guide\n-----------------------------------\n\n.. toctree::\n    :maxdepth: 2\n    :glob:\n\n    bgp-control-plane-troubleshooting\n    bgp-control-plane-operation",
