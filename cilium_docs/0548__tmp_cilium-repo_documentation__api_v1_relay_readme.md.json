The message applies to all nodes in node_names. \n \n \n NodeState \n Name Number Description \n UNKNOWN_NODE_STATE 0 UNKNOWN_NODE_STATE indicates that the state of this node is unknown. \n NODE_CONNECTED 1 NODE_CONNECTED indicates that we have established a connection to this node. The client can expect to observe flows from this node. \n NODE_UNAVAILABLE 2 NODE_UNAVAILABLE indicates that the connection to this node is currently unavailable. The client can expect to not see any flows from this node until either the connection is re-established or the node is gone. \n NODE_GONE 3 NODE_GONE indicates that a node has been removed from the cluster. No reconnection attempts will be made. \n NODE_ERROR 4 NODE_ERROR indicates that a node has reported an error while processing the request. No reconnection attempts will be made. \n \n Scalar Value Types \n .proto Type Notes C++ Java Python Go C# PHP Ruby \n  double double double float float64 double float Float \n  float float float float float32 float float Float \n  int32 Uses variable-length encoding.
