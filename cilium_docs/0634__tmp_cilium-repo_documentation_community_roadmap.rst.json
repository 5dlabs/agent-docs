We label issues with `good-first-issue`_ to help new potential\ncontributors find issues and feature requests that are relatively self-contained\nand could be a good place to start. Please also read the :ref:`dev_guide` for\ndetails of our pull request process and expectations, along with instructions\nfor setting up your development environment.\n\nWe encourage you to discuss your ideas for significant enhancements and feature\nrequests on the ``#development`` channel on `Cilium Slack`_, bring them to the\n:ref:`community-meeting`, and/or create a `CFP design doc`_.\n\nThe project does not give date commitments since the work is dependent on the\ncommunity. If you're looking for commitments to apply engineering resources to\nwork on particular features, one option is to discuss this with the companies\nwho offer `commercial distributions of Cilium <enterprise_>`_ and may be able to\nhelp.\n\nRelease Cadence\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe aim to make 2 to 3 `point releases`_ per year of Cilium and its core components\n(Hubble, Cilium CLI, Tetragon, etc.). We also make patch releases available as\nnecessary for security or urgent fixes. \n\nFocus Areas\n-----------\n\nFor a finer-granularity view, and insight into detailed enhancements and fixes,\nplease refer to `issues on GitHub <GitHub issues_>`_. The Cilium committers_ are the\nmain drivers of where the project is heading.\n\nWelcoming New Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs a CNCF project we want to make it easier for new contributors to get involved\nwith Cilium. This includes both code and non-code contributions such as\ndocumentation, blog posts, example configurations, presentations, training\ncourses, testing and more. Check the :ref:`dev_guide` documentation to understand how to get\ninvolved with code contributions, and the `Get Involved`_ guide for guidance on\ncontributing blog posts, training and other resources.\n\n.. _committers: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cilium/cilium/main/MAINTAINERS.md\n.. _GitHub issues: https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues\n.. _point releases: https://cilium.io/blog/categories/release/\n.. _Get Involved: https://cilium.io/get-involved\n.. _good-first-issue: https://github.com/cilium/cilium/labels/good-first-issue\n.. _enterprise: https://cilium.io/enterprise\n.. _CFP design doc: https://github.com/cilium/design-cfps/tree/main\n",
