The name includes the cluster name if a value other than default has been specified. This value can be used to uniquely identify the host. When the cluster name is not the default, the cluster name is prepended to the peer name and a forward slash is added. \n \n Examples: - runtime1 - testcluster/runtime1 |\n| address |  string  |  | Address is the address of the peer's gRPC service. |\n| type |  ChangeNotificationType  |  | ChangeNotificationType indicates the type of change, ie whether the peer was added, deleted or updated. |\n| tls |  TLS  |  | TLS provides information to connect to the Address with TLS enabled. If not set, TLS shall be assumed to be disabled. | \n \n NotifyRequest \n \n TLS \n TLS provides information to establish a TLS connection to the peer. \n Field Type Label Description \n server_name string ServerName is used to verify the hostname on the returned certificate. \n \n \n ChangeNotificationType \n ChangeNotificationType defines the peer change notification type. \n Name Number Description \n UNKNOWN 0 \n PEER_ADDED 1 \n PEER_DELETED 2 \n PEER_UPDATED 3 \n \n \n Peer \n Peer lists  hubble peers and notifies of changes. \n Method Name Request Type Response Type Description \n Notify NotifyRequest ChangeNotification  stream Notify sends information about hubble peers in the cluster. When Notify is called, it sends information about all the peers that are already part of the cluster (with the type as PEER_ADDED). It subsequently notifies of any change. \n \n Scalar Value Types \n .proto Type Notes C++ Java Python Go C# PHP Ruby \n  double double double float float64 double float Float \n  float float float float float32 float float Float \n  int32 Uses variable-length encoding.
