# Task 20: Production Deployment and Validation

## Overview

Execute final production deployment with comprehensive validation ensuring all acceptance criteria are met in the live environment.

## Implementation Guide

- Execute production deployment using GitHub Actions
- Validate all 10 query tools with real-world queries
- Test Rust crate management operations
- Verify Streamable HTTP transport with client integration
- Confirm cost reduction through batch processing
- Validate performance benchmarks and scaling

## Technical Requirements

- GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- Comprehensive acceptance testing suite
- Performance validation (< 2s query response)
- Load testing (100+ concurrent connections)
- Cost reduction validation (70% savings)
- Stakeholder acceptance testing

## Success Metrics

- All 10 query tools functional in production
- Streamable HTTP transport working with all clients
- 70% cost reduction achieved and validated
- Query response times < 2 seconds under load
- 100+ concurrent connections supported
- Zero critical issues in production environment## CI/CD and Code Quality Requirements

- Per-function linting: After creating any new function, immediately run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and resolve all warnings.
- Pre-commit checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` must pass locally.
- Branching: Implement on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/<task-id>-<short-name>`).
- CI gate: Push to the feature branch and monitor GitHub Actions until all jobs are green and deployment completes successfully.
- PR creation: Only open the pull request after CI is green and the deployment stage has succeeded.
