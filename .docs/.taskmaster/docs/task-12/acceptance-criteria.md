# Acceptance Criteria: Task 12 - Rust Crate Management Tools Enhancement

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Tool Enhancements

- [ ] `add_rust_crate` supports version/feature selection and rollback on failure
- [ ] `remove_rust_crate` performs cascade deletion with soft-delete option
- [ ] `list_rust_crates` supports pagination, filtering, and stats
- [ ] `check_rust_status` reports health, counts, update status, and basic performance

### 2. Robustness and Integration

- [ ] Atomic DB transactions with proper error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting for external calls (docs.rs)
- [ ] Integration with embedding batch processing (Task 7)

### 3. Performance Targets

- [ ] `add_rust_crate` completes within reasonable time for typical crates
- [ ] `list_rust_crates` and `check_rust_status` respond < 2s

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Consistent error handling and logging
- [ ] Zero data corruption on failures (rollback)
- [ ] Tests for core operations and edge cases

### 2. Code Quality and Consistency

- [ ] All tools follow identical patterns from RustQueryTool
- [ ] Shared utilities used consistently across implementations
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- [ ] Proper documentation comments for all public functions
- [ ] Zero clippy warnings and proper rustfmt formatting

### 3. Reliability and Robustness

- [ ] Graceful handling of missing or malformed metadata
- [ ] Proper fallback behavior for unsupported content types
- [ ] Thread safety for concurrent query operations
- [ ] Resilient to database connection issues
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all documentation types

## Test Cases

- [ ] Add popular crate (tokio) end-to-end succeeds
- [ ] Remove crate cascades and soft-delete works
- [ ] List with pagination and filters returns expected data
- [ ] Status reports accurate metrics and detects updates

## Deliverables

- [ ] Updated tools with docs and tests
- [ ] Database helpers and migrations if needed

### Testing Suite

- [ ] Unit tests for all utility functions
- [ ] Individual tool functionality tests
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests
- [ ] Error handling and edge case tests
- [ ] Concurrent usage tests

### Documentation and Quality

- [ ] Code documentation comments
- [ ] Usage examples for each tool
- [ ] Performance optimization notes
- [ ] Error handling documentation
- [ ] Metadata schema definitions

## Validation

```bash
cargo test --package mcp crate_management
cargo test --package database crate_operations
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

## Definition of Done

Task 11 is complete when:

1. **Complete Implementation**: All seven query tools fully implemented and functional
2. **Shared Utilities**: Common functionality extracted to reusable module
3. **Database Integration**: Optimized queries for each documentation type
4. **Testing Complete**: Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing
5. **Performance Validated**: All response time targets consistently met
6. **Caching Working**: Performance improvement demonstrated for repeated queries
7. **Quality Gates**: All clippy warnings resolved and code properly formatted
8. **Documentation Updated**: Code properly documented with usage examples

## Success Metrics

- 100% of query tools respond within 2-second target
- Shared utilities reduce code duplication by 80%
- Caching improves repeated query performance by 50%
- Zero critical errors in comprehensive test suite
- All metadata fields properly parsed and displayed
- Consistent formatting across all seven tools
- Thread-safe operations under concurrent load
- Error handling covers 95% of edge cases identified### NFR-0: Code Quality and Automation
- [ ] After adding any new function, run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` and fix all warnings before continuing
- [ ] Prior to submission, ensure `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic`, and `cargo test --all-features` all pass locally
- [ ] All changes pushed to a feature branch; GitHub Actions must complete successfully (including deployment) before opening a PR
- [ ] PR creation is gated on a green CI pipeline and successful deployment of the server artifact
